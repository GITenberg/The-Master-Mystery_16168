    <h2>THE MASTER MYSTERY</h2>

    <h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

    <p>Peter Brent sat nervously smoking in the library of his
    great house, Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>He was a man of about forty-five or -six&mdash;a typical,
    shrewd business man. Something, however, was evidently on his
    mind, for, though he tried to conceal it, he lacked the
    self-assurance that was habitually his before the world.</p>

    <p>A scowl clouded his face as the door of the library was
    flung open and he heard voices in the hall. A tall, spare,
    long-haired man forced his way in, crushing his soft black hat
    in his hands.</p>

    <p>"I <i>will</i> see Mr. Brent," insisted the new-comer, as he
    pushed past the butler. "Mr. Brent!" he cried, advancing with a
    wild light in his eyes. "I'm tired of excuses. I want justice
    regarding that water-motor of mine." He paused, then added,
    shaking his finger threateningly, "Put it on the
    market&mdash;or I will call in the Department of Justice!"</p>

    <p>Brent scowled again. For years he had been amassing a
    fortune by a process that was scarcely within the law.</p>

    <p>For, when inventions threaten to render useless already
    existing patents, necessitating the scrapping of millions of
    dollars' worth of machinery, vested interests must be
    protected.</p>

    <p>Thus, Brent and his partner, Herbert Balcom, had evolved a
    simple method of protecting corporations against troublesome
    inventors and inventions. They had formed their own
    corporation, International Patents, Incorporated.</p>

    <p>Their method was effective&mdash;though desperate. It was to
    suppress the inventor and his labor. They bought the sole
    rights from the inventor, promising him glittering royalties.
    The joker was that the invention was suppressed. None were ever
    manufactured. Hence there were no royalties and the
    corporations went on undisturbed while Brent and Balcom
    collected huge retainers for the protection they afforded
    them.</p>

    <p>Thus Brent Rock had come to be hated by scores of inventors
    defrauded in this unequal conflict with big business.</p>

    <p>The inventor looked about at the library, richly paneled in
    oak and luxuriously furnished. Through a pair of folding-doors
    he could see the dining-room and a conservatory beyond. All
    this had been paid for by himself and such as he.</p>

    <p>"Sit down, sir," nodded Brent, suavely.</p>

    <p>The man continued to stand, growing more and more excited.
    Had he been a keener observer he would have seen that under
    Brent's suavity there was a scarcely hidden nervousness.</p>

    <p>Finally Brent leaned over and spoke in a whisper, looking
    about as though the very walls might have ears.</p>

    <p>"My dear fellow," he confided, "for some time I have been
    considering your water-motor. I will return the model to
    you&mdash;release the patent to the world."</p>

    <p>He drew back to watch the effect on the aged inventor. Could
    it be that Brent was lying? Or was it fear? Could it be that at
    last his seared conscience was troubling him?</p>

    <p>At that exact moment, up-stairs, in a private laboratory in
    the house, sat a young man at a desk&mdash;a handsome,
    strong-faced, clean-cut chap. All about him were the scientific
    instruments which he used to test inventions offered to
    Brent.</p>

    <p>A look of intent eagerness passed over his face. For Quentin
    Locke was not testing any of Brent's patents just now. Over his
    head he had the receivers of a dictagraph.</p>

    <p>It was a strange act for one so recently employed as manager
    of Brent's private laboratory. Yet such a man must have had his
    reasons.</p>

    <p>One who was interested might have followed the wire from the
    dictagraph-box in the top drawer of the desk down the leg of
    the desk, through the very walls to the huge chandelier in the
    library below, where, in the ornamented brass-work, reposed a
    small black disk about the size of a watch. It was the
    receiving-end of the dictagraph.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the young man's face broke out into a smile and
    without thinking he stopped writing what the little mechanical
    eavesdropper was conveying him from below. He listened intently
    as he heard a silvery laugh over the wire.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I didn't know you were busy. I thought these
    flowers&mdash;Well, never mind. I'll leave them, anyway."</p>

    <p>It was Eva Brent, daughter of the head of the firm, who had
    danced in from the conservatory like a June zephyr in
    December.</p>

    <p>"My dear," Locke could hear the patent magnate welcome, "it
    is all right. Stay a moment and talk to this gentleman while I
    go down to the museum."</p>

    <p>Locke listened eagerly, glancing now and then at a
    photograph of Eva Brent on his own desk, while she chatted
    gaily with the inventor. It was evident that Eva had not the
    faintest idea of the hard nature of the business of her
    father.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Brent himself had left the library and passed
    through the portièred door into the hall. He did not turn up
    the grand staircase in the center of the wide hall, but
    hurried, preoccupied, to a door under the stairs that opened
    down to the cellar.</p>

    <p>He started to open it to pass down. As he did so he did not
    hear a light footstep on the stairs as his secretary, Zita
    Dane, came down. But he did not escape her watchful eye.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Brent," she called, "is there anything I can do?"</p>

    <p>Brent paused. "Wait a moment for me in the library," he
    directed, as he turned again to enter the cellar.</p>

    <p>He closed the door and Zita watched him with an almost
    uncanny interest, then turned to the library to join Eva and
    the new-comer.</p>

    <p>Down the cellar steps Brent made his way, and across the
    cellar floor, pausing at the rocky wall of the foundation of
    the house blasted and hewn out of the cliff on which it towered
    above the river. A heavy steel door in the rock wall barred the
    way.</p>

    <p>Brent whirled the combination and shot the bolts, and the
    door swung ponderously open, disclosing a rock-hewn cavern.
    Three walls of the cavern were lined with shelves containing
    inventions of all kinds&mdash;telegraph and telephone
    instruments, engine models, railroad-signaling and safety
    devices, racks of bottles containing dangerous chemicals and
    their antidotes&mdash;all conceivable manner of mechanical and
    scientific paraphernalia. It was literally a Graveyard of
    Genius&mdash;harboring the ghosts of a thousand inventors' dead
    hopes.</p>

    <p>Brent entered hastily and went directly to a shelf. There he
    picked up a model of a motor. He blew the dust from it and
    examined it approvingly.</p>

    <p>Suddenly he saw something that caused him to start. He
    looked down at his feet. There was a piece of paper on the
    floor.</p>

    <p>He picked it up and read it, and as he did so he started
    back, frightened&mdash;then angry. He looked about at the
    rock-hewn cavern walls&mdash;then read again:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">Brent</span>&mdash;This is my last
        warning. If you persist in your course you will be struck
        down by the Madagascar madness.</p>

        <p class="author">Q.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Under his breath, Brent swore. Again he looked about the
    cavern, then turned hurriedly, picked up the motor, passed out
    the steel door, clanged it shut, and locked it.</p>

    <p>No sooner had Brent shut the door, however, than it seemed
    as if the very face of the outer rocky wall of the cavern began
    to move&mdash;to tilt, as if on hinges.</p>

    <p>If a human eye had been in the Graveyard of Genius at that
    instant it would have sworn that it perceived in the inky
    blackness of the tilting rock a passage, and in the shadows of
    that passage a huge, weird, grotesque figure peering in.</p>

    <p>Then the tilting rock door closed again, as the figure
    disappeared down the rocky passage on the opposite side&mdash;a
    menace and a threat to the owner of Brent Rock, insecure even
    in his millions.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

    <p>When Brent arrived back at the library he had quite
    recovered his poise, at least to the eyes of those in the
    library. Zita had joined Eva with the old inventor, Davis.</p>

    <p>As Brent entered, Davis uttered an exclamation of joy at the
    sight of his motor. For the moment Brent almost glowed.</p>

    <p>"Along with your invention," he beamed, as he handed the
    model to the old man, "I am going to release many others to the
    world."</p>

    <p>All this not only Locke was noting, but Zita, too, appeared
    to be an almost too interested listener.</p>

    <p>The others were chatting when Zita heard a noise in the hall
    and hurried out. She was just in time to see a rather
    hard-visaged man, with cruel, penetrating eyes. It was Herbert
    Balcom, vice-president of the company.</p>

    <p>Zita whispered to him a moment and Balcom's hard face grew
    harder.</p>

    <p>"Go up-stairs&mdash;watch <i>him</i>," he ordered, passing
    down the hall.</p>

    <p>Balcom entered the library just as Davis was about to leave,
    hugging close to him his brain child. Davis clutched it a bit
    closer at sight of the other partner.</p>

    <p>A glance would have been sufficient to show that Brent was
    secretly afraid of his partner, Balcom, and that Balcom
    dominated him.</p>

    <p>"Go to the gate with him, my dear," whispered Brent to his
    daughter, who was clinging to his arm, convinced of the
    goodness of her father, ignorant of the very basis on which the
    Brent and Balcom fortune rested.</p>

    <p>Balcom's mouth tightened as he came closer to Brent,
    menacing, the moment they were alone.</p>

    <p>"How long has this double crossing been going on?" sneered
    Balcom, jerking his head toward the door through which Eva had
    just gone with the inventor, and shoving his face close to
    Brent's.</p>

    <p>"It's not double crossing, Balcom," Brent attempted to
    conciliate, "but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No 'buts,'" interrupted Balcom, with deadly coldness. "Keep
    on, and you'll have the government down on us for violating the
    anti-trust law. What's the matter? Have you lost your
    nerve?"</p>

    <p>As Balcom almost hissed the question, up in the laboratory
    Locke was now writing furiously in his note-book, when he was
    interrupted by a knock at the door. He whipped the dictagraph
    receiver off his head and jumped to his feet, hiding all traces
    of the dictagraph in the desk drawer. Then he moved over to the
    door, unlocked it, and flung it open.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I hope I haven't interrupted you in any important
    experiment," apologized Zita, innocently enough.</p>

    <p>"Nothing important," camouflaged Locke.</p>

    <p>Though Locke did not seem to notice it, another would have
    seen that Zita cared a great deal for him.</p>

    <p>"May I come in?" she asked, wheedling.</p>

    <p>"Certainly. I am charmed, I assure you."</p>

    <p>While Zita was gushingly effusive, Locke was correct and
    formally polite as he bowed his acquiescence. Zita felt it.</p>

    <p>For a moment she stood looking at a half-finished experiment
    on the laboratory table, then finally she turned to Locke with
    a calculated impulsiveness.</p>

    <p>"Why do you treat me so coldly," she asked, "when you know I
    admire your wonderful work?"</p>

    <p>"Really, Miss Dane," he apologized, "I didn't mean to be
    rude."</p>

    <p>Yet there was an air of constraint in his very tone.</p>

    <p>"Do you know," she flashed, "I can't help feeling that you
    are so brilliant&mdash;you must be something more than you
    seem."</p>

    <p>Locke suppressed a quick look of surprise. Was she trying to
    worm some secret from him? He masked his face cleverly.</p>

    <p>"Indeed, you must be imagining things," he replied, quietly,
    turning and strolling toward the window of his laboratory.</p>

    <p>The moment his back was turned Zita picked up the photograph
    of Eva on the desk. For a moment she stood glaring at it
    jealously.</p>

    <p>Out of the window Locke smiled. For, down on the gravel
    path, walking slowly toward the gate to the Brent Rock grounds,
    he could see Eva and Davis.</p>

    <p>The smile faded into a scowl. He had seen a young man enter
    the gate. It was Paul Balcom, son of Herbert Balcom, and Paul
    was engaged to Eva&mdash;thus giving Balcom a stronger hold
    over Brent.</p>

    <p>Locke knew enough about Paul to dislike him thoroughly and
    to distrust him. Had Locke been able to see over the hedge he
    would have confirmed his suspicions. For Paul had actually
    driven up to Brent Rock in the runabout of as notorious a woman
    as could have been found in the night life of the
    city&mdash;one known as De Luxe Dora in the unsavory half-world
    in which both were leaders. Had his dictagraph been extended to
    the hedge he would have heard her voice rasp at Paul:</p>

    <p>"Your father may make you pay attention to this girl, Paul,
    but remember&mdash;you had not better double cross me."</p>

    <p>Paul's protestations of underworld fidelity, would have
    added to Locke's fury.</p>

    <p>However, Locke had not seen or heard. Still, it was
    unbearable that this fellow Paul should be engaged to a girl
    like Eva. Tall, dark, handsome though he was, Locke knew him to
    be a man not to be trusted.</p>

    <p>Paul hurried up to Eva, not a bit disconcerted at the near
    discovery of his intimacy with Dora. And, whatever one may
    believe about woman's intuition, there must have been something
    in it, for even at a distance one could see that Eva mistrusted
    Paul Balcom, her fiancé. Locke scowled blackly.</p>

    <p>Paul thrust himself almost rudely between Davis and Eva.
    Again Davis shrank, as he had from the young man's father, then
    bowed, excused himself, and hurried off, hugging his motor to
    him, while Paul took Eva's hand, which she was not any too
    willing to give him. Locke watched, motionless, as the couple
    turned back to the house.</p>

    <p>Somehow Eva must have felt his gaze. She turned and looked
    upward at the laboratory window. As she saw Locke her face
    broke into a smile and she waved her hand gaily. Paul saw it
    and a swift flush of anger crossed his face. He pulled Eva
    abruptly by the arm.</p>

    <p>"Let's go into the house," he said, almost angrily.</p>

    <p>Seeing the action, Locke also turned from the window to
    encounter Zita, still watching. Without a word he left the
    laboratory.</p>

    <p>While this little quadrangle of conflicting emotions of
    Locke, Eva, Paul, and Zita was being enacted the two partners
    in the library were disputing hot and heavy. As they argued,
    almost it seemed as if Balcom's very face limned his
    thoughts&mdash;that he desired Brent out of the way, as a
    weakling in whom he had discovered some traces of conscience
    which, to Balcom, meant weakness.</p>

    <p>Balcom leaned forward excitedly. "I do not intend to let you
    wreck this company because your conscience, as you call it, has
    begun to trouble you," he hissed.</p>

    <p>Brent's hand clutched nervously. He was afraid of
    Balcom&mdash;so much so that he fought back only weakly.</p>

    <p>Locke was down in the hallway just in time to meet Eva and
    Paul as they entered.</p>

    <p>"Oh&mdash;do you know, I'm so glad&mdash;I think my father
    is the most kind-hearted of men," Eva trilled to Locke, as she
    recounted what had happened in the library with Davis.</p>

    <p>Locke listened with restrained admiration for the girl,
    whatever might have been his secret opinion of her father or of
    the story he already knew.</p>

    <p>On his part, Paul did not relish the situation, nor did he
    take any pains to conceal it. He shrugged and turned away.</p>

    <p>"Come," he said, with a tone of surly authority, "I think I
    hear my father in the library."</p>

    <p>Eva looked back swiftly at Locke and smiled as Paul led her
    toward the library door. But that, also, made Paul more
    furious.</p>

    <p>"Why do you make me ridiculous before that fellow?" he
    demanded.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry," replied Eva, in surprise. "I didn't meant to do
    that."</p>

    <p>Vaguely Paul understood. The girl was too unsophisticated to
    have meant it. Somehow that made it worse. Though she did not
    know it, he did. Unknown to herself, there was a response in
    the presence of Locke which was not inspired in his own
    society. He hurried her into the library.</p>

    <p>It was as though the entrance of Paul and Eva had been
    preconcerted. The partners, in their dispute, stopped and
    turned as the young people entered and moved over to a divan.
    Balcom lowered his voice and plucked at Brent's sleeve as he
    nodded toward the couple.</p>

    <p>"I could trust you better if they were married within a
    week," suggested Balcom.</p>

    <p>Brent recoiled, but Balcom affected not to notice.</p>

    <p>"Then I will believe that you are dealing fairly with me,"
    he emphasized.</p>

    <p>Brent studied a moment, then nodded assent. Balcom extended
    a cold, commanding hand and the partners shook hands.</p>

    <p>Outside, Locke had paused, about to enter the library. The
    pause had been just long enough for him to hear&mdash;and it
    was a blow to him. He watched, dazed, as the two older men
    walked over to the younger couple; then he turned away, heart
    sick.</p>

    <p>"My dear," began Brent, as he patted the shoulder of the
    girl, the one spot of goodness that had shone in the otherwise
    blackness of his life, making him at last realize the depth to
    which lust of money had made him sink, "we were just saying
    that perhaps it would be advisable to&mdash;er&mdash;hasten
    your marriage to Paul&mdash;say&mdash;perhaps next week."</p>

    <p>The words seemed to stick in his throat.</p>

    <p>As for Eva, she felt a shiver pass over her. Without knowing
    why, she drew back from Paul, at her side, shrank even closer
    to her father, trying not to tremble. Did Paul realize it?</p>

    <p>Brent felt the shudder with a pang. He leaned over. "Promise
    to do this&mdash;for my sake," he whispered, so low that there
    was no chance of the others hearing. "By to-morrow all may be
    changed."</p>

    <p>There was something ominous about the very words.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

    <p>Brent had no intention of keeping the promise which Balcom
    had extracted from him by a species of moral duress that
    afternoon.</p>

    <p>In fact, already he had gone too far in his plans for
    restitution&mdash;or was it self-preservation?&mdash;to turn
    back. It was late in the night that he himself secretly
    admitted to the house a tall, dark-haired stranger who
    evidently called by appointment.</p>

    <p>"Well, Flint," he greeted, in a hushed tone, "what was it
    you asked to see me about?"</p>

    <p>Flint replied not a word, but impressively tapped a bundle
    which he carried under his arm and began to undo the cord which
    bound it.</p>

    <p>Brent looked startled, then caught himself. He had known
    Flint for some time&mdash;an adventurer, more or less
    unscrupulous, who had been the foreign representative of
    International Patents.</p>

    <p>Flint took off his coat and threw it on a chair with an air
    of assurance that seemed to increase Brent's anxiety, then
    began again to untie the bulky package.</p>

    <p>"Just a moment, Flint," cautioned Brent, stopping him.</p>

    <p>With an air of uneasy secrecy Brent hurried to the door that
    led from the dining-room to the conservatory and bolted it
    securely. Then he made sure that the door to the library was
    bolted.</p>

    <p>As he did so he did not see his secretary, Zita, watching in
    the hall, for the footsteps of Locke, approaching, had caught
    her quick ear and she had fled.</p>

    <p>"Locke!" called Brent, hearing his laboratory, manager.
    "Under no circumstances allow me to be disturbed to-night."</p>

    <p>"Very well, sir," responded Locke.</p>

    <p>Just then the light step of Eva was heard on the stairs.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, father?" she asked, still upset by the
    events of the afternoon. "Is there anything wrong?"</p>

    <p>"No, my dear, nothing," hastily replied Brent. "In the
    morning I shall have something to say to you. Now run along
    like a good girl."</p>

    <p>Dutifully Eva turned. Brent watched her out of sight. Then
    with a keen look at Locke he pulled out a paper from his pocket
    and handed it to the young scientist, who read:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">Brent</span>,&mdash;This is my last
        warning. If you persist in your course you will be struck
        down by the Madagascar madness.</p>

        <p class="author">Q.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Locke looked up from the scrawl in alarmed perplexity.</p>

    <p>"What does this mean?" he queried.</p>

    <p>Brent merely shook his head cryptically.</p>

    <p>"Study this message. I shall have something very important
    to tell you in the morning."</p>

    <p>As Brent turned back into the library he paused a moment and
    looked after Locke, hesitating, as if he would call him back.
    Then he decided not to do so, turned, and carefully locked the
    door from the dining-room into the hallway.</p>

    <p>Eva was waiting at the head of the stairs as Locke,
    perplexed by the strange actions of his employer, came up.</p>

    <p>"What <i>is</i> the trouble?" she repeated, anxiously.
    "Please tell me. Is there anything wrong?"</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;nothing," reassured Locke, in spite of his own
    doubt. "Everything is all right."</p>

    <p>"I hope so." Eva lingered. "Good night."</p>

    <p>Locke bowed admiringly. But there was the same restraint in
    his look that had been shown in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>"Good night," he murmured, slowly.</p>

    <p>Eva quite understood, and there was a smile of encouragement
    on her face as she turned away and flitted down the hall to her
    room.</p>

    <p>Outside, Zita had hurried from the house to the nearest
    public telephone-booth and was frantically calling Balcom at
    his apartment.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Balcom," she repeated, breathlessly, as the junior
    partner answered, "Flint has returned. I have seen him."</p>

    <p>"The devil!" exclaimed Balcom, angrily, then checked himself
    before he said any more. "Keep me informed."</p>

    <p>Abruptly he hung up.</p>

    <p>It was scarcely a moment later that Paul Balcom entered the
    Balcom apartment, admitted by a turbaned black suggestive of
    the Orient.</p>

    <p>Paul was surly and had evidently been drinking, for he
    shoved the servant roughly out of the way as he strode toward
    his father.</p>

    <p>Apparently outside Paul had overheard and had gathered the
    drift of what Balcom had been saying. Or perhaps, from his own
    sources of information, he already knew. At any rate, as Balcom
    turned from the telephone, father and son faced each other
    angrily.</p>

    <p>"Brent's lying," exclaimed Paul. "That marriage to me must
    take place to-morrow."</p>

    <p>Talking angrily, sometimes in agreement, at others far
    apart, the two left the room.</p>

    <p>Back in the dining-room by this time Brent had rejoined
    Flint and now watched him eagerly as he took the last wrappings
    from the package which he had carried so carefully.</p>

    <p>As the last wrapping was stripped from it, on the table
    before them lay a small steel model, perhaps three feet
    high&mdash;a weird-looking thing in the miniature shape of a
    man, designed along lines that only a cubist could have
    conceived&mdash;jointed, mobile, truly a contrivance at which
    to marvel.</p>

    <p>Brent gazed incredulously at the strange thing. "An
    automaton!" he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"More than that," replied Flint, calmly.</p>

    <p>Flint unrolled a chart of the human nervous system and
    spread it out on the table. Pointing to the brain, he leaned
    over tensely, and whispered:</p>

    <p>"This model is merely a piece of mechanism. But the real
    automaton possesses a human brain which has been transplanted
    into it and made to guide it."</p>

    <p>For a moment Brent listened incredulously, then sat back in
    his chair and laughed skeptically. But even Flint recognized
    that there was a hollowness in the laughter.</p>

    <p>"Do you mean to tell me," demanded Brent, "that a human
    brain has been made to control a thing of no use except as a
    terrible engine of destruction?"</p>

    <p>"Not only possible," reiterated Flint, "but it is true."</p>

    <p>"Oh, Flint," rallied Brent, with a sort of uneasiness, "you
    can't tell <i>me</i> that!"</p>

    <p>"Believe it or not," insisted the adventurer, "I have been
    in Madagascar and I know."</p>

    <p>For a moment Brent paused at the vehemence of Flint's
    answer. What had Flint to gain by misrepresentation? A thousand
    images of the past flitted through Brent's brain. Then slowly a
    look of terror came over Brent's face. Suppose it were indeed
    true&mdash;this Frankenstein, this conscienceless inhuman
    superman? Brent gripped himself and composed his features and
    his voice.</p>

    <p>"But this thing," he rasped. "What does this prove?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, this is merely automatic&mdash;a piece of
    mechanism&mdash;a model which I stole. It works when it is
    wound up&mdash;not like the real one. Look."</p>

    <p>Flint put a pencil in the little steel hand of the model and
    pressed a lever as he held a piece of paper under the pencil.
    Brent leaned over, fascinated.</p>

    <p>Instantly the tiny hand began to trace on the paper one
    letter&mdash;the simple letter "Q."</p>

    <p>As the hand finished the tail of the "Q" Brent gripped the
    table for support. His eyes bulged and stared wildly.</p>

    <p>"My God!" burst from his lips. "It is the
    warning&mdash;Q!"</p>

    <p>For minutes Brent strove to regain his composure.</p>

    <p>Nor was Flint less impressed than the man before him.</p>

    <p>What would have been the emotions of both if they had been
    able to penetrate with the eye through the rocky cliffs on
    which the stately mansion of Brent Rock stood would have been
    hard to say.</p>

    <p>For, down in a rock-hewn cavern, not many hundred yards away
    and below them, reached by a secret entrance from the shrubbery
    of the cliffs near the shore, already had congregated several
    rough characters. They were playing cards and drinking, now and
    then glancing furtively at the passage entrance, as though they
    were expecting the arrival of some one or something.</p>

    <p>Suddenly came a dull metallic clank through the passage,
    strangely echoing. At once all leaped to their feet, at
    attention, not unmixed with awe and fear that sat strangely on
    their desperate features. What was it that they, who feared
    neither God nor man, feared?</p>

    <p>They strained their eyes, looking into the passage that led
    darkly away into blackness.</p>

    <p>Dimly down it now could be seen two gleaming spots of light,
    points in the Cimmerian darkness. They seemed to be growing
    larger and coming nearer as with each hollow reverberation the
    dull metallic thuds increased.</p>

    <p>Faintly now could be made out in the blackness a huge,
    stalking figure, having the shape of a man, with gigantic,
    powerful shoulders, powerful arms, a thick body, hips, and
    thighs that spelled terrific strength, legs and feet that
    suggested irresistible force.</p>

    <p>"The Automaton!" escaped involuntarily from all lips.</p>

    <p>Slowly, irresistibly, the horrendous figure stalked forth
    into the dim light. There it paused for a moment&mdash;a figure
    of steel, larger than most men, yet not so large but that it
    might have incased a man. And yet its motions, its every
    action, were like nothing mortal. Even these hardened denizens
    of the underworld shuddered.</p>

    <p>In its hand the Automaton carried a five-branched
    candlestick, for what purpose none seemed to know. Yet all
    bowed and quaked at every pantomime motion of the figure, ready
    to do the bidding of the least motion of their inhuman
    master.</p>

    <p>Still holding the candlestick with its five huge yellow
    candles before him, the Automaton stalked forward to the table
    and impressively deposited the candlestick on it, then stepped
    back a pace and waved his ponderous hand at the assembled
    emissaries, who scarcely repressed their own abject terror.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

    <p>At a motion from the Automaton a dark-skinned Madagascan
    stepped forward and lighted the five candles. At once a dense
    smoke began drifting from the candles.</p>

    <p>The men looked at one another, showing an uncomfortable fear
    of what the negro and the Automaton were doing. Even the negro
    edged away fearfully and all crouched back, afraid of the
    fumes.</p>

    <p>A moment later the Automaton, with a mighty blast of air,
    snuffed all the candles at once, then, without a word, picked
    up the candlestick and stalked off through the passage on the
    opposite side of the den from the entrance, the passage that
    led to the Graveyard of Genius.</p>

    <p>A few moments later the secret rock door from this passage
    into the Graveyard swung open and the Automaton stalked in,
    going carefully, noiselessly, now. Across the floor he walked
    to the steel door, which he swung open, then on out into the
    cellar of Brent Rock and up the steps to the door under the
    stairs that led to the hallway of the great house.</p>

    <p>In the hall the Automaton halted beside a small stand on
    which stood a candlestick exactly like the one he carried.
    Quickly he picked up the original candlestick and replaced it
    by the one he carried. Then he set the original back of the
    portières, and with a glance at the library door turned back to
    the cellar, closing the door noiselessly behind him.</p>

    <p>Down the steps he went, toward the open door of the
    Graveyard of Genius. Beside the door was the fuse-box of the
    lighting system of the house.</p>

    <p>The Automaton reached out and began rubbing sharply at the
    insulation of the feed wires.</p>

    <p>Up-stairs, in the dining-room, Brent had by this time flung
    off his coat and was examining with Flint the curious model the
    adventurer had brought from Madagascar. Brent was very excited
    and questioned Flint eagerly.</p>

    <p>"I tell you, Flint," cried Brent, at length, huskily, as he
    seized a pen and dipped in into the ink, "the time has come for
    me to do what I have long intended. I am going to do now what I
    should have done years ago."</p>

    <p>Brent started to write feverishly:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">Quentin Locke</span>,&mdash;I have
        done you a great injury about which you know nothing, but I
        am willing to&mdash;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>His hand had scarcely traced the last word when the room was
    plunged into absolute darkness.</p>

    <p>Down in the cellar the Automaton had succeeded in rubbing
    off the insulation of the feed wires. There was a flash of
    light as he laid his steel hand over the two feed
    wires&mdash;then darkness.</p>

    <p>In the dining-room Brent and Flint, already keyed to the
    highest pitch, leaped to their feet with an exclamation of
    terror.</p>

    <p>Late as it was, Locke was working in his laboratory on the
    second floor of the house when the lights winked out. Surprised
    for the moment, he ran out into the hall.</p>

    <p>Already there was the butler, groping about with a
    candle.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, Quentin?" asked a breathless voice
    behind them.</p>

    <p>It was Eva in a filmy dressing-gown. Locke turned to vision
    a creation of loveliness in the candle-light which set his
    heart thumping.</p>

    <p>"Nothing," he reassured. "Just the lights short-circuited,
    that's all. I'll see."</p>

    <p>Just then the dining-room door opened and Eva saw her
    father, disheveled and preoccupied, stride out and take the
    five-branched candlestick from the hall table. Nervously he
    began to light the candles. They sputtered a bit and he turned
    quickly, still holding the candlestick, as the smoke drifted
    away from them all.</p>

    <p>"Fix the fuses in the cellar," he directed the butler.</p>

    <p>"Is anything&mdash;really the matter&mdash;father?" implored
    Eva.</p>

    <p>"No, no, my child," he answered, hastily. "Go back to bed.
    And, Locke, please don't let us be disturbed."</p>

    <p>He was about to say more, then decided not to do so, and
    turned back into the dining-room.</p>

    <p>Again Brent carefully locked the door to the dining-room and
    rejoined Flint.</p>

    <p>He had placed the candles on the table, not noticing in the
    half-light that the smoke from them was growing denser as they
    burned down.</p>

    <p>The smoke drifted over as the draught carried it. Flint
    coughed and moved a bit, his hand at his throat.</p>

    <p>Brent seized the pen again and was about to write, when the
    smoke from the candles drifted into his own face. He, too,
    coughed.</p>

    <p>Uneasy, Brent glanced over at Flint. Flint laughed, a bit
    hysterically.</p>

    <p>"What the devil's the matter?" demanded Brent, with lowered
    brows, a strange dryness in his throat.</p>

    <p>Flint was now leaning forward on his elbows and laughing
    foolishly, stupidly. It was a queer laugh, and struck terror
    into Brent as he himself coughed and clutched involuntarily at
    his throat. Brent stared at Flint.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" he repeated, anxiously. "Have you suddenly
    gone mad, man?"</p>

    <p>But there was no reply. Instead, Flint laughed all the more
    madly.</p>

    <p>Brent was more than startled. If he could have seen himself
    in a glass he would have seen that he was already wide-mouthed
    and disheveled. Suddenly the smoke again blew in his face. He
    coughed again. His head reeled.</p>

    <p>Then, in a flash, it all dawned on him.</p>

    <p>He shielded himself from the candles. But it was too
    late.</p>

    <p>"My God!" he exclaimed, starting up. "The Madagascar
    madness!"</p>

    <p>Brent looked about wildly. He rushed to Flint and shook him.
    But Flint only laughed. He turned and moved toward the candles,
    reaching out for them. But even as he did so his hand
    faltered.</p>

    <p>He stopped and passed his hand across his tightening
    forehead. Slowly over his face came a stupid expression. He
    felt himself going, without power of retraining himself. His
    lips twitched and he swayed.</p>

    <p>Then he began to laugh uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>Flint rose and clapped him on the shoulder. Then both
    laughed foolishly, loudly.</p>

    <p>They were beyond help. It was the laughing madness.</p>

    <p>Outside, in the hall, Eva and Locke had been standing,
    talking for a moment, when suddenly, below, they heard a
    terrific noise in the cellar. Involuntarily Eva's hand clutched
    Locke's arm. Locke drew a revolver and, in spite of Eva's
    fearsome caution, hastened down the cellar stairs.</p>

    <p>About in the blackness of the cellar he groped until his
    foot touched something soft, a mass on the floor. He bent over.
    It was the butler, in a heap, unconscious, but still
    breathing.</p>

    <p>There was not a sound, not another being in the cellar.</p>

    <p>Together Eva and Locke helped the now half-conscious man to
    his feet and pushed and pulled him up the stairs; as slowly he
    recovered his power of speech.</p>

    <p>"What was it&mdash;tell us?" urged Locke.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I went down to fix the fuses&mdash;as the master
    ordered," muttered the butler, incoherently. "A huge
    figure&mdash;steel hand&mdash;it flung me across the
    floor&mdash;the last I remember."</p>

    <p>He passed his hand over his head as though recollection even
    was too horrible for description.</p>

    <p>Locke listened a bit doubtfully, then sent the butler on his
    way to bed, while Eva could scarcely restrain her fears.</p>

    <p>Over to the dining-room door Locke strode and listened.
    There was nothing but the sound of merriment inside, of
    uncontrollable laughter. Could it be that Brent and Flint were
    drinking? He dared not betray a fear to Eva. Instead he
    knocked.</p>

    <p>At that moment he could hear the sound of some heavy body
    falling; then more laughter as Brent in his hysteria struck the
    model of the automaton to the floor.</p>

    <p>With the model, unnoticed by Brent, now fluttered to the
    floor the letter he had been writing. But the madman paid no
    attention to that now as it sifted through the air and
    fluttered under the sideboard.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Brent," called Locke, "please open the door."</p>

    <p>Instead of an answer came a loud and insulting laugh,
    followed by an incoherent mouthing of words. Eva looked
    startled, blanched. It was so unlike her father. For the moment
    Locke was piqued. But he tried not to show it as he turned away
    from the door.</p>

    <p>"I am your father's employe," he said, sadly, "and it is his
    privilege, I suppose, to laugh at me." He hesitated.</p>

    <p>"Oh, but, Quentin&mdash;Mr. Locke&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm so
    sorry. Surely he could not have meant it."</p>

    <p>At the head of the stairs Locke tried to smile.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry," he said, repressing his feelings. "It will
    make no difference between us. Good night."</p>

    <p>They parted, Eva closing her door for a sleepless night,
    Locke to work far into the night in his laboratory until sheer
    exhaustion overcame his feelings.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the dining-room, the two men kept terrible
    vigil, hour after hour, oblivious of time, in wild and wanton
    laughter&mdash;maniacal abandon.</p>

    <p>A terrible blow had been struck and Reason was tottering on
    her throne.</p>

    <p>Two men had been stricken by an unknown hand&mdash;stark,
    stark mad.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

    <p>"Father&mdash;please&mdash;open the door!"</p>

    <p>It was early the following morning that the butler with
    frightened face had called Eva Brent to tell her that her
    father and Flint had been locked in the dining-room all night
    and were still laughing madly.</p>

    <p>Eva had hurried down-stairs, encountering Zita as she ran.
    It was true. She could hear the voices inside. Nor could she
    get any answer from the two men.</p>

    <p>"Oh&mdash;Zita&mdash;please&mdash;can't something be
    <i>done</i>?" Eva implored.</p>

    <p>With a hasty word Zita hurried away just as Herbert Balcom
    himself entered the house from the street.</p>

    <p>In utter surprise Balcom nodded at Zita as she poured forth
    the story of what had been discovered in the morning, then
    pushed past her in high excitement.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" he asked as he came upon the butler and Eva
    still knocking excitedly at the dining-room door.</p>

    <p>Eva was almost in a panic as she answered, "Father and Mr.
    Flint have been in there laughing ever since last night."</p>

    <p>Balcom tried to comfort her. But somehow his sympathy sent a
    cold shudder through the poor girl.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Zita had encountered Locke hurrying down at the
    sound of the commotion. To him she told the story, again hurt
    that his interest was solely for Eva, not in herself.</p>

    <p>Locke paused long enough to seize an umbrella from the rack,
    rip the cover off, and break out a rib, to which he tied a
    piece of string while he hurried to the group at the door.</p>

    <p>"Break down the door and call the police," ordered
    Balcom.</p>

    <p>The butler reached for a chair and was about to swing it
    over his head to break down the door.</p>

    <p>"Stop!" interrupted Locke.</p>

    <p>The young scientist knelt down, inserted the umbrella steel
    through the keyhole, and bent it by the string as he fished
    about with it on the other side to find the bolt. Meanwhile the
    butler telephoned frantically for the police.</p>

    <p>It was at this height of excitement that Paul Balcom
    entered. A moment's talk with Zita, and he, too, joined the
    group.</p>

    <p>Sympathetically he spoke to Eva, but Eva scarcely responded
    in the fashion of a girl to the man whom she was going to
    marry. Her attention was riveted on Locke, who was kneeling
    before the door. Paul saw it and an ominous scowl crossed his
    face.</p>

    <p>Carefully Locke worked the umbrella steel and the string
    until he had caught the bolt. Then he shot the bolt back and
    rose to his feet. All watched him expectantly as he threw open
    the door.</p>

    <p>Such a sight as met their eyes one could scarcely
    picture.</p>

    <p>There were Brent and Flint at the
    table&mdash;laughing&mdash;laughing. The candles had long since
    burned out. On the floor lay the automaton model.</p>

    <p>"Father!" cried Eva, running to him.</p>

    <p>But there was no look of recognition on Brent's face.</p>

    <p>"Don't you know me? Speak to me! Father!"</p>

    <p>Instead, Brent merely patted her shoulder and laughed
    hollowly. Eva, on her knees by him, sobbed and smoothed his
    head by turns.</p>

    <p>Locke, bending over Flint, found him in much the same
    condition.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Balcom and Paul had picked up the model of the
    automaton and exchanged a quick glance.</p>

    <p>"This man Locke's actions are suspicious," exclaimed Balcom,
    hastily. "He was in the house last night."</p>

    <p>Outside they could hear the arrival of the detectives
    summoned by the butler.</p>

    <p>"Go to Eva," nudged Balcom to Paul.</p>

    <p>A moment later the butler entered with the detectives.</p>

    <p>At the sight of the automaton model in Balcom's hands the
    butler cried out:</p>

    <p>"That is what attacked me last night&mdash;only
    larger&mdash;much larger!"</p>

    <p>All eyes were now on the butler. Quickly Balcom took
    advantage of the situation thus created. Locke, also, left
    Flint and moved over to the group examining the model. As he
    did so his eye caught a piece of paper under the sideboard. He
    was about to pick it up when he realized that all were looking
    at him. Quickly he covered his discovery and faced them.</p>

    <p>"This man is the stranger in the house," cried Balcom, in
    anger. "Arrest him and make him explain."</p>

    <p>It was the work of only an instant for the chief detective
    to step up to Locke and slip the bracelets on his wrists.</p>

    <p>"Don't!" cried Eva.</p>

    <p>"Please&mdash;my dear&mdash;your father," remonstrated
    Paul.</p>

    <p>At that instant Brent was seized with another violent fit of
    coughing and laughter. Eva, distracted, was half fainting.</p>

    <p>Thus, with Locke handcuffed, Balcom and Paul were
    triumphant.</p>

    <p>Locke saw his chance. But the handcuffs prevented him from
    using his hands. In the instant that all were diverted toward
    Brent, with incredible deftness Locke slipped his hand from the
    cuffs, one link of which fell open as if by magic, through a
    secret all his own. He reached down and picked up the paper
    under the sideboard and read it. It was the letter Brent had
    been writing and served only to increase his perplexity. He
    read it again, then crushed it into his pocket, and before any
    one had discovered his trick had slipped his hand back into the
    cuffs and they were locked again.</p>

    <p>At that very moment the telephone rang and the chief of the
    detectives answered. As he did so a perplexed expression
    crossed his face and he walked over quickly to Locke.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;beg your pardon," he apologized as he began to
    unlock the handcuffs.</p>

    <p>"Here, my man, what are you doing?" interrupted Balcom.</p>

    <p>"I know my business. You lay off," growled the
    detective.</p>

    <p>A moment later Locke, with a slight smile on his handsome
    face, was answering the telephone.</p>

    <p>Not a soul save the detective, even yet, suspected the true
    identity of Locke, even as he answered over the telephone with
    a respectful, "Yes, sir."</p>

    <p>The fact of the matter was that the message had come most
    opportunely. It was from the chief of the Department of Justice
    himself, ordering Locke to stay at the house until he had
    secured the evidence that would allow the department to proceed
    against the company under the anti-trust law. That, then, was
    the explanation of the secret dictagraph which Locke had
    installed, the explanation of his apparent faithlessness to his
    employer.</p>

    <p>But weightier matters were now on Locke's mind. Here he was
    faced by the case of his life, involving the happiness of the
    very girl whom he had so soon come to love. His incentive was
    double&mdash;love and success: triple&mdash;above all,
    justice.</p>

    <p>By this time the household themselves were sufficiently calm
    to help Brent to his bedroom and Flint to a guest-chamber.</p>

    <p>Balcom was about to follow, when Locke, returning from the
    telephone, touched him on the shoulder and shoved the threat
    message which Brent had given him the night before under the
    face of the junior partner.</p>

    <p>"Read that," he demanded.</p>

    <p>Balcom read, controlling his features admirably, if control
    were necessary.</p>

    <p>"What's the meaning of this?" he demanded, coldly.</p>

    <p>"Were you in Madagascar lately?" shot back Locke.</p>

    <p>Locke could not be sure whether or not Balcom suppressed a
    start. At any rate, he did not conceal anger at the
    insinuation.</p>

    <p>"Certainly," he replied. "With my son I cruised through the
    Mozambique Channel and touched at Madagascar last summer.
    Why?"</p>

    <p>Locke nodded and the detective made a note of the reply.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean to insinuate by that question?" demanded
    Balcom.</p>

    <p>Without reply Locke shrugged nonchalantly and smiled.</p>

    <p>Not ten feet away, in the conservatory door, Paul listened,
    and his face darkened as he clenched his fists.</p>

    <p>There was a murderous glare in Paul's eyes as Locke
    unconcernedly withdrew, whispering to the detective, who nodded
    deferentially to the young scientist who had been assigned by
    the Department of Justice, strangely, to the very case which
    now he realized in some unknown way must concern himself and
    the very mystery of his own identity.</p>

    <p>So wore along the morning, with growing mystery and
    excitement.</p>

    <p>It was not long before the Brent family physician was
    summoned, and after a careful diagnosis pronounced Brent in a
    hopeless state as far as his own science was concerned. Eva was
    by this time more than frantic. The consolation of Paul seemed
    to add to her nervousness. She was almost distracted when she
    heard Balcom and the doctor discussing the case in low tones in
    her father's room.</p>

    <p>"Don't you think, Doctor," she overheard, "that he would be
    far better off in a sanitarium?"</p>

    <p>She shuddered as the doctor agreed with Balcom, and Balcom
    sought to persuade her that the course was best. Even the
    solicitations of Paul annoyed her. Paul was more than vexed at
    this new repulse from his bride-to-be. His anger knew no bounds
    as he caught sight of Locke, who had overheard and showed his
    doubt over the whole proposal for the care of Brent. He plucked
    at his father's sleeve and nodded toward Locke.</p>

    <p>Balcom needed no prompting from his crafty son.</p>

    <p>"I'll have you understand, Locke," he cried, his face
    growing apoplectic red, "that I am in charge here now. Your
    services are no longer required."</p>

    <p>"I quite understand," returned Locke, quietly. "We shall
    see."</p>

    <p>Balcom stormed down from the room to the telephone, where, a
    moment later, he telephoned to an asylum, asking them to send a
    conveyance with nurses, keepers, and whatever paraphernalia was
    necessary to take care of his partner, Brent.</p>

    <p>"Is he violent?" demanded the doctor over the telephone.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Bring a strait-jacket," snapped back Balcom. "And the
    sooner he is under your care the better."</p>

    <p>With that Balcom stamped out of the house.</p>

    <p>In Brent's room, Paul was attempting still to ingratiate
    himself with Eva, who was growing more distant toward him with
    every moment. Finally Paul could stand it no longer. He turned
    on his heel and faced Locke angrily in the hall.</p>

    <p>"You'll regret this, confound you!" he ground out, as he
    swung out of the room rapidly in a high state of feeling.</p>

    <p>Unconcernedly Locke turned on his heel.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry," he whispered to Eva. "I'll see that no harm
    comes to your father."</p>

    <p>For answer, her own heart too full for words, Eva pressed
    the hand of the young scientist. It was reward enough for
    Locke.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, at Doctor Shaw's sanitarium, to which Balcom had
    telephoned with the permission of the doctor, elaborate
    preparations had been completed for the reception and
    transportation of Brent.</p>

    <p>It was perhaps an hour later that the ambulance, with three
    white-uniformed attendants, pulled out, carrying all those
    appurtenances necessary for the care of the insane, including
    the strait-jacket which Balcom had so testily suggested.</p>

    <p>That same hour had seen intense activity in another quarter.
    In the den of the Automaton, the hard-visaged emissaries had
    been already roused by the entrance of the Automaton.</p>

    <p>Hasty directions had been uttered by the metallic,
    phonograph voice of the monster, and already four of the most
    desperate of the characters had hurried through the entrance
    out on the cliffs. The Automaton himself had turned toward the
    passage through the Graveyard of Genius to Brent Rock
    itself.</p>

    <p>Thus it happened that when the ambulance from Doctor Shaw's
    sanitarium came bowling along the road to Brent Rock as fast as
    its motor would permit, the driver was forced suddenly to put
    on the brakes to save himself from being wrecked by a huge log
    that lay squarely across the road.</p>

    <p>No sooner had the attendants jumped out to remove the log
    than four desperate men fell upon them from ambush, beat them,
    and left them trussed up and unconscious, while they donned the
    jackets and uniforms of Doctor Shaw's men, seized the
    ambulance, and swung off again at a fast clip in the direction
    of Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>Lulled into a false security, as her father slept now for a
    time under an opiate, Eva was sitting beside him with loving
    care when she heard the noise below of the arrival of the car
    from Doctor Shaw's sanitarium. At once she was in wild alarm.
    Nor was Locke off his guard. While Zita tried to reassure Eva,
    Locke met the men.</p>

    <p>There were four of them, and as the first passed, Locke
    halted him. The parley gave another a chance to push past,
    while Locke held three at bay.</p>

    <p>A moment later there was a scream from Eva, who had hurried
    from her father's room at the sound of the high voices. The
    emissary had seized her.</p>

    <p>It was a signal for the other three, who leaped on Locke all
    at once. With almost superhuman strength Locke seized one of
    them and flung him over his head for a fall down the whole
    flight of steps as he fought the other two single-handed.</p>

    <p>Even then the third came back to the attack and Locke was
    forced to give back step by step down the stairs.</p>

    <p>Another scream from Eva.</p>

    <p>In the heat of the fray Locke caught a glimpse of her
    battling on the landing above with the first emissary. It gave
    him redoubled strength.</p>

    <p>Flinging the two men off and eluding the third, he leaped to
    the chandelier in the hall and with a giant swing wrapped his
    legs about the fellow struggling with Eva. Literally throttling
    him, he pulled him backward over the balcony railing for a fall
    clear to the lower hall.</p>

    <p>At the moment when Locke was actually subduing all of his
    assailants the door to the cellar suddenly opened and the huge
    figure of the Automaton strode out.</p>

    <p>With one blow of his steel fist the monster struck Locke
    senseless, then turned and began ascending the grand
    staircase.</p>

    <p>Almost paralyzed with fear, Eva screamed again and fled
    through the nearest door, locking it. On strode the Automaton,
    crashing down the door as if it had been a mere shell.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the emissaries had seized Locke, still unconscious
    and unable to resist. Feverishly they began to bind him in the
    strait-jacket which they had taken from the ambulance. Then
    they carried him and flung him roughly on the floor of the
    library.</p>

    <p>Still screaming, Eva fled to the next room, again bolting
    the door and piling furniture frantically to barricade it.
    Again the Automaton rained blow after blow on the door. It
    splintered, and his powerful fist began breaking and
    overturning the barricade which the unfortunate girl had
    improvised.</p>

    <p>Wildly she looked about. Only a closet now offered refuge.
    The door was splintered through. She could see the terrible
    face of the monster.</p>

    <p>In the library, Locke, recovering by this time, began
    flopping and twisting, spurred by the muffled screams from
    above-stairs as he worked with miraculous dexterity to release
    himself from the strait-jacket.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

    <p>Locke struggled with superhuman effort to release himself
    from the strait-jacket in which he was held prisoner. The
    throat-straps pressed against the neck muscles and the strain
    on the straps could be heard like pistol-shots as the leather
    stretched under his prodigous efforts.</p>

    <p>With every nerve keyed up and his reflexes answering his
    keen brain, he swayed backward and forward, rolled from side to
    side until his shoulder-blades were thrown completely out of
    joint. The pain was intense, but he summoned every ounce of
    strength at his command and finally succeeded in getting one of
    his arms free by gradually working his body toward a settee,
    where, with his elbow on the seat, he pushed his disjointed arm
    over his head.</p>

    <p>Agony was written all over his face as at last with a final
    effort he extricated his arms and was in a position to loosen
    the straps which bound them, with his teeth.</p>

    <p>Nor was his labor over now. The canvas jacket cut into his
    flesh and the buckles bruised his muscles. His body ached with
    weariness, yet he clung to his task. Like a thing incarnate he
    toiled as he realized the danger that confronted Eva.</p>

    <p>Up-stairs, the monster was pursuing Eva. The heavy oaken
    doors were as straws to him, and he plunged through them as a
    mad elephant dashes through a canebrake. Destruction lay in his
    wake as he crashed through the improvised barriers which Eva
    had constructed to delay his onslaught. A crouching, desolate
    figure, she waited for what she knew to be her end. There was
    only one barrier left between her and this engine of
    destruction. It was only a moment now when she would be a
    crushed, mangled mass. With terror in her heart she waited for
    the thing to crash through the last remaining barrier, and even
    now she could hear his ponderous step as he crossed the room
    toward the door which would only momentarily stay his progress.
    Her lips moved in prayer as she waited and the dread moments
    seemed eons to her.</p>

    <p>Suddenly she heard a crash, and she could see the panels of
    sturdy oak in the door give way as though they were egg-shells.
    The gigantic fist of the monster crashed through and she could
    discern the dim outline of the enormous head, and the glaring
    eyes of fire looking toward her. With a shrill shriek she
    raised her arms above her head and fell swooning to the floor
    just as a pistol-shot rang out.</p>

    <p>Locke, disheveled and weak, had released himself from the
    strait-jacket, and with the speed of a panther had ascended the
    stairs. He saw the monster crashing through the last remaining
    barrier, and without hesitation he fired at the thing as he
    closed in. His one thought was to delay it or make it swerve in
    its course momentarily, with the hope that by some chance Eva
    might have time to escape. Could he only accomplish this, he
    thought his mission successful, regardless of the outcome as
    far as he himself was concerned.</p>

    <p>He pulled the trigger of his automatic again and again as he
    rushed forward. By some strange trick of fate the figure reeled
    for a second and one of its arms dropped swinging to its side.
    The bullet had entered a joint. Had it in some way deranged the
    mechanism, causing the Automaton to turn in its tracks and
    confront Locke as he charged forward? Or was some human being
    concealed in the armored creature and wounded?</p>

    <p>Eva, in her semi-conscious state, saw the mass of metal
    charge toward Locke, and closed her eyes so as not to be a
    witness to his end. She waited, dumb and helpless with fright,
    and before her surged the meaning of this man's great sacrifice
    for her. In the brief interval she realized that men of his ilk
    were few. She realized that her interest in the young chemist
    was more than a passing fancy and the truth was driven home to
    her in his hour of peril. She closed her eyes and all before
    her went blank.</p>

    <p>As the Automaton faced Locke voices could be heard in the
    hall, and the gardener of Brent Rock, who had summoned aid,
    came to Locke's assistance. Armed with clubs and garden tools,
    the men charged the monster. Like a lion at bay, the thing
    turned from its task of destroying Locke to face its new
    enemies. <i>En masse</i> they attacked the Automaton, but it
    shook them off, one by one, as a terrier would rats, and made
    its way toward the grand staircase. Some of the gardener's aids
    suffered broken bones, while others were left unconscious as a
    result of the conflict.</p>

    <p>Locke picked himself up and rushed to Eva's side. He took
    the prostrate form in his arms and looked down into her
    beautiful face. The room was in ruins, and Eva slowly opened
    her eyes and looked up at him. Her hand went out in a momentary
    caress, but as she fully recovered consciousness she moved her
    hand away lest he really know. She looked up at him gratefully,
    and Locke, a little confused, took his arm from around her
    waist. With boyish bashfulness he hung his head and asked her
    if she was all right. The sound of his own voice amid the ruins
    brought back his composure.</p>

    <p>"We must see about father. Perhaps something has happened to
    him," said Eva, as she started toward the door.</p>

    <p>Locke looked after the girl, then followed her.</p>

    <p>Propped up in bed, Peter Brent presented a pitiable sight.
    His glassy stare and shrill laugh like a coyote baying at the
    moon sent cold chills down Eva's back as she entered the room.
    This man, at one time a power in the business world, was only a
    shell of his former self, and his inhuman laughter caused even
    Locke to shudder a little as he entered the room.</p>

    <p>Eva walked over to her father and put her hand to his brow,
    looking wistfully in his eyes for some sign of recognition.</p>

    <p>She kissed him on the forehead and called him, but he still
    stared blankly ahead of him, unconscious of even her presence.
    Locke felt the pulse of the patient and looked at the dilated
    pupils.</p>

    <p>"There must be some antidote for this Madagascar madness,
    and I shall move everything to find it," he said, as he looked
    at Eva with determination.</p>

    <p>She turned toward him eagerly as he spoke and his words gave
    her a little cheer. Eva continued her caresses, but the
    demented man showed no signs of recognizing even his own
    daughter.</p>

    <p>From another room the shrill laughter of Flint could be
    heard as he raved in delirium. Bereft of reason, he fought an
    unseen enemy.</p>

    <p>"Q did it, I tell you&mdash;it's Q," he raved and shrieked
    in his insane way as he rocked back and forth in bed. He was
    fighting his own conscience, and kept pushing some unseen thing
    from him as he shook in a paroxysm of fright.</p>

    <p>The front-door bell rang and Balcom entered. He was suave in
    manner, but this time he seemed a little excited as he gave his
    hat and stick to the butler.</p>

    <p>"Tell Miss Brent I must see her at once," he ordered.</p>

    <p>As the butler turned to mount the stairs, Balcom reached his
    hand up and rubbed his shoulder as though he were in pain.
    Perhaps the gesture meant nothing, but a keen observer would
    have noticed that his arm did not move with the freedom that
    one would expect of a man of his frame and build. As he rubbed
    his shoulder his eyes followed the butler up the stairs and his
    lips tightened. He watched him until he was out of sight, then
    turned and entered the library.</p>

    <p>As Balcom entered the library the door-bell rang and the
    three ambulance men who had been overpowered by the emissaries
    of the Automaton entered. Balcom approached them and hasty
    explanations were forthcoming. In his suave manner he quieted
    the most noisy of the trio, who by this time had found the
    strait-jacket from which Locke had just released himself.</p>

    <p>"This looks like a put-up job to me," growled the driver, as
    he confronted Balcom, holding the strait-jacket toward him.
    "And I believe you know something about it."</p>

    <p>"My dear man, I am the person who telephoned for you to come
    for my stricken partner," said Balcom, "and I still insist that
    he is in dire need of treatment."</p>

    <p>As he spoke Eva entered the library in time to hear him. She
    was followed by Locke.</p>

    <p>"My father shall not be taken from this house," she cried,
    in reply to Balcom's orders to the attendants.</p>

    <p>As she spoke she turned toward Locke and looked at him for
    his acquiescence. He quietly nodded toward her in an assuring
    manner, and as he did so one might have noticed Balcom's face
    cloud up with evil purpose. He was thinking of this young
    whipper-snapper and his interference with his plans. As he
    stood meditating he noticed that Locke was looking at him, so
    he turned toward the young chemist and his whole expression
    changed. A bland smile crept across his face as he spoke.</p>

    <p>"I was only suggesting that my partner be taken to an
    institution, because I believed that he would receive better
    treatment there." He addressed Locke, but looked toward Eva as
    he did so. "Miss Brent should have trust in me. I have only her
    interest at heart."</p>

    <p>"It would be better for Mr. Brent to stay here," said Locke.
    "The treatment his daughter can give will be better than that
    of an outsider."</p>

    <p>As he spoke he sauntered away with an air of finality, while
    Balcom shrugged his shoulders and gave orders to the ambulance
    men to go.</p>

    <p>Locke walked toward the dining-room, and there amid the
    candle drippings and the wreckage of the night before espied
    the miniature automaton. He picked it up and examined it
    minutely as Balcom strolled in.</p>

    <p>Balcom's quick gaze caught what Locke was looking at, and he
    approached the young chemist and sauvely said:</p>

    <p>"It seems almost unbelievable, Mr. Locke, that a giant form
    like that could be endowed with a human brain."</p>

    <p>As he spoke he pointed toward the miniature automaton in
    Locke's hands. Locke turned and faced him, his jaw tightening
    with a snap.</p>

    <p>"Not unbelievable, but impossible, Mr. Balcom," he said. "I
    believe that there is some one in this thing that attacks us
    and calls himself Q."</p>

    <p>He eyed Balcom as he spoke, to see the effects of his words.
    But if Balcom knew anything, he cunningly concealed it. Locke
    walked to the table and closely examined the candles and other
    stuff strewn about. He was looking for some clue to what had
    caused the madness of Brent and Flint. The crumpled anatomy
    chart lay on the floor, and as Locke stooped to pick it up Eva
    entered and came toward him. She shuddered slightly as she
    passed the miniature of the monster, and Balcom, with an air of
    satisfaction, noticed her fear. He turned and was about to go
    out, when the butler entered with the duplicate candlestick in
    his hands.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Locke, in cleaning the hall I found this behind the
    portières at the entrance to below-stairs," he announced. "I
    was quite puzzled for a moment, for I knew the master had taken
    it into the dining-room with him last evening."</p>

    <p>As he spoke he handed the candlestick to Locke, who quickly
    compared it with the one on the dining-room table which
    contained the burnt candles.</p>

    <p>In appearance the candelabra were identical. Locke with
    great care examined every feature of them, looking for a clue.
    He took one of the whole candles from the candlestick which the
    butler had brought in and scraped the wax from in with his
    penknife. He examined the particles carefully, then approached
    the candlestick which stood on the table the fatal night, and
    very carefully removed the wax from the stumps of candles which
    were still in the sockets.</p>

    <p>"The Madagascar madness came from <i>that</i> candlestick,"
    he announced, with assurance, as he pointed toward the one on
    the table.</p>

    <p>While he was so busily engaged Balcom was eying him
    cunningly. He watched his every move and was most intent in
    seeing just how the young man would prove his contention.</p>

    <p>"Good morning, every one!" came the clear voice of Paul as
    he entered the room and crossed over to the side of his
    fiancée. He was particular to ignore Locke in his greeting, and
    as he approached Eva he bent over her hand and kissed it.</p>

    <p>A close observer would have noticed that the girl rather
    drew her hand back from his caress.</p>

    <p>"I am so sorry about your father, Eva," whispered Paul. "I
    trust the ailment is but temporary."</p>

    <p>As he spoke Eva thanked him mechanically for his
    solicitations, while Balcom glanced at his son in
    admiration.</p>

    <p>Locke, who was still engaged in looking at the candle
    drippings through his pocket magnifying-glass, paid slight
    attention to Paul, but glanced up in time to see that there was
    a look of insincerity on his face.</p>

    <p>Could it be that this young scion of the Balcom fortune
    could in any way be connected with the Automaton? Could this
    man, this suave, polished gentleman, have any motive for
    seeking the ruin or death of his fiancée? Locke seemed to be
    busily engaged in his task, but he was making mental notes on
    the conduct of young Balcom. He looked up finally and turned to
    Eva.</p>

    <p>"Miss Brent, I find minute particles of some foreign
    substance in the wax of these candles," he announced. "They
    seem to be of organic origin and I am certain that they contain
    the poison which has robbed your father of his mentality. I am
    going to take them to a chemical laboratory where there will be
    proper facilities to have them analyzed. Perhaps there is an
    antidote that will restore your father's sanity."</p>

    <p>As Locke spoke he carefully wrapped up the particles of
    drippings in a piece of paper and put them in his pocket. As he
    did so, both Balcom and Paul exchanged hurried glances, and
    Balcom left the group and started toward the hall.</p>

    <p>During all this procedure Zita, clad in a sumptuous morning
    frock hardly befitting a secretary, was standing behind the
    portières in the hall and listening intently to all she could
    hear within the dining-room. As she heard Balcom's footsteps
    she hurriedly turned and seemed to be going up the hall. He
    looked after her and then called.</p>

    <p>She came toward Balcom with a nod of understanding, and, as
    she approached, he led her to a corner of the hall and
    whispered to her.</p>

    <p>"It is imperative that we get Flint out of the house
    to-night. I can trust you to take care of this if I arrange the
    details?"</p>

    <p>Zita quickly nodded acquiescence, looking furtively over her
    shoulder to see if they were observed.</p>

    <p>"I will get him to your apartment," she hurriedly said, as
    she looked up at him for further instructions.</p>

    <p>Balcom turned quickly from her, got his own hat and sack,
    and departed, just as Locke came into the hall, bound for the
    chemist's shop. He looked after the disappearing form of
    Balcom, and then turned and noticed that he was being watched
    by Zita. Zita in turn hastily entered the library, without
    looking over her shoulder.</p>

    <p>"I wonder what her real position in this house can be,"
    mused Locke, as he took his hat and went toward the front
    door.</p>

    <p>In the dining-room Paul was now standing close to Eva and
    had taken her hand.</p>

    <p>"You know it was your father's wish that we be married," he
    was saying, "and I know that he would be happy if we had the
    ceremony performed at once."</p>

    <p>His eyes narrowed as he said this, but Eva was too
    preoccupied to see it. With a shudder, ever so slight, she
    looked up at his handsome face and spoke.</p>

    <p>"I will not even speak of marriage until my father recovers,
    Paul, and I don't know how you can ask me to at such a
    time."</p>

    <p>She was not thinking so much of her father as of a certain
    young chemist who had risked his life for her. Why had fate
    thrown him in her way, she wondered. What was there about
    Quentin Locke that compelled her attention&mdash;that made her
    feel secure when he was about? What was the difference between
    the young chemist and Paul that she felt perfect trust in the
    one whom she had known only a short time and distrust and
    uncertainty in the other to whom she was about to be
    married?</p>

    <p>She hung her head and went into the drawing-room, leaving
    Paul standing there. He looked after her, and a slight smile
    crossed his face as he thought of what a fool she was to think
    that he cared for her. His self-assurance led him to believe
    that the reason that Eva was not consenting to his proposal was
    indeed because of her father's condition, for he little
    dreamed, nor would his egotism permit him to believe, that
    anything else could be the case.</p>

    <p>His mouth hardened in a subtle smile as he sauntered after
    Eva to bid her farewell. He remembered that De Luxe Dora was
    waiting outside for him in her speedster.</p>

    <p>He had made this paramour of his take him to the very door
    of his fiancée's home, and there wait until he had paid his
    respects to the moneyed lady who would make happiness possible
    by supplying him with the funds to pursue his pleasures and
    insure his father's hold on the International Patents,
    Incorporated.</p>

    <p>Paul looked at his watch, then, after a few words of
    condolence which would hardly sound sincere from any one less
    gifted, made a hurried departure toward the corner where the
    speedster was waiting.</p>

    <p>"Who was the funny gink that hurried by a little while ago?"
    queried Dora, in the vernacular of her calling. "He gave me the
    double O as though he had something on me."</p>

    <p>"That's a fellow we've got to look out for, kid," answered
    Paul, in the same terms by which he was addressed, for, if
    nothing else, Paul could be as much at home in the underworld
    as in a mansion on the Drive. "Brent claimed that he was a
    chemist before he went 'bugs,'" continued Paul, "but I have my
    doubts; in fact, I'm very leery of him because I think he's a
    fly cop."</p>

    <p>He took his place beside Dora, who started the car and
    headed down-town.</p>

    <p>After Paul's departure Eva hurried to her father's room and
    tried to comfort him. He was seated in a chair, staring blankly
    ahead of him. He was quieter now, but his body twitched
    nervously from time to time.</p>

    <p>The tears started to come to Eva's eyes as she saw her
    father's plight, and she knelt down beside him and took his
    hand in hers. She stroked it with her own hand and bent over
    and kissed it. As she knelt, crying softly, she sobbed
    half-aloud:</p>

    <p>"Why can't I confide in you, father? Why can't you advise
    me? I don't love Paul Balcom and could never marry him. I know
    I love Quentin Locke&mdash;I do&mdash;I do&mdash;"</p>

    <p>As she sobbed she bent over his hand and pressed it to her
    lips.</p>

    <p>Peter Brent sat staring into space, staring like a graven
    image.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

    <p>After her brief encounter with Balcom in the hallway Zita
    stealthily mounted to Flint's room.</p>

    <p>Flint's condition was unchanged. He lay sprawled out in a
    huge arm-chair, his head swaying from side to side, as he
    muttered and mumbled incoherently, while his leering smile
    caused even Zita to shudder.</p>

    <p>She was, however, alive to the importance of her mission.
    Steeling herself, she raised Flint from the chair and steadied
    him with one hand while she tried to smooth out the wrinkles of
    his clothing so that his mad condition would not be too
    apparent when they went outdoors. It was a hard task, but Zita
    soon accomplished it and, half supporting, she led him through
    a door on the farther side of the room. They crept down a back
    stairway and so away from the house.</p>

    <p>At times Flint stumbled and almost fell, and once that
    insane laugh startled a passer-by, who started after them, then
    changed his mind and proceeded on his way. It was then that
    Zita's heart almost stopped beating. She realized that the
    situation would be unexplainable to a stranger and she urged
    the insane Flint on faster.</p>

    <p>Renewed hope came to her with each step. She had almost
    relaxed her precautions when, suddenly, from a clump of bushes,
    several men leaped out. They seized Flint, who merely started
    babbling afresh. Zita, ignorant of what was really happening,
    struck out right and left in the hopeless encounter, until one
    of the men with a grin seized her wrist in his powerful grasp
    and twisted it until she screamed with pain. Then she realized
    for the first time that she had fallen into the hands of the
    emissaries of the Automaton. Had Balcom planned it, or had that
    mechanical monster taken advantage of what Balcom had
    ordered?</p>

    <p>In the mean time, the other thugs, with Flint between them,
    made off hurriedly. With a last push that almost threw Zita to
    the ground, the last of them dashed into the shrubbery, and for
    several moments Zita dazedly stood there as he crashed through
    the underbrush, making good the escape and capture. Then she
    turned and ran back to Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>Locke, in the mean time, had arrived at the laboratory of
    his old friend Hadwell, the chemist, where he was warmly
    welcomed.</p>

    <p>It was the usual dusty workshop of one devoted to one
    idea&mdash;science&mdash;with no touches of comfort. Hadwell
    fairly lived amid retorts, Bunsen burners, and reagents.</p>

    <p>He was a man of profound research, rather than the
    commercial chemist, and it was from him that Locke, in earlier
    days, had learned many lessons so well that now his career was
    watched with interest by many distinguished men of science.</p>

    <p>Hadwell was delighted at the chance to examine the strange
    scrapings of wax which Locke had dug out of the sockets of the
    candlestick, the more so as they must contain some mysterious
    poison. First he studied them under a powerful lens, then by
    chemical reactions, until he made visible some peculiar
    crystals. Locke himself was amazed as his friend worked.</p>

    <p>"You don't know it all&mdash;yet&mdash;my boy," smiled the
    aged professor. "There's still something the old teacher can
    add to your education, and I'm glad, Quentin, very glad, for it
    will draw you closer to me again. I need you to carry on my
    work when I must lay it down. I'm not positive," he continued,
    "but I believe these crystals to be those of <i>Dhatura
    stramonium</i>, and, as you say speed's the thing, we'll begin
    by noting the effect of the stuff as a gas on that guinea-pig
    over there."</p>

    <p>"Have you masks?" asked Locke, with true scientific
    caution.</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;on the shelf. You're keen, Quentin. These fumes
    can penetrate the tiniest aperture and, if my guess is right,
    without a mask, you would quickly laugh yourself to death."</p>

    <p>"Don't, Professor, don't joke, for there is no joy in that
    mad laughter. It is horrible, maddening, even to the hearer.
    Let us get to work. The father of the girl I love may even now
    be sinking to his death. We must determine the nature of this
    deadly stuff, and then find an antidote."</p>

    <p>The chemist brought out the cage in which the guinea-pig was
    placidly munching a lettuce leaf, and placed it in a convenient
    spot on the table. Then, after Locke, as well as the professor,
    had carefully adjusted the masks, the latter lighted a Bunsen
    burner and applied the flame to the deadly crystals. A pungent
    fume was given off and collected in a rubber bag, or cone, from
    which a long tube protruded.</p>

    <p>This tube the chemist introduced into the cage. For a moment
    there was no perceptible change in the animal's actions. Then
    it stopped eating, sniffed at the strange odor, and commenced
    to twitch violently. This twitching continued for several
    minutes, when the creature started to revolve in circles, like
    a Japanese dancing-mouse. Finally it became subject to spasms,
    and, although the professor withdrew the tube, these symptoms
    continued.</p>

    <p>"I was right!" he cried. "It is an especially poisonous
    variety of that almost unknown Oriental drug, <i>Dhatura
    stramonium</i>. I think I can find an antidote to it, also. To
    work, my boy, to work!"</p>

    <p>One experiment after another resulted in failure, however,
    and it was while they were so engaged that the telephone bell
    rang and a feminine voice inquired for Locke.</p>

    <p>It was an excited Eva who called. "Quentin," she burst
    forth, breathlessly, "what do you think has happened? The
    strangest thing! Flint has escaped. Tell me what to do. Can't
    you come to me at once? I need you."</p>

    <p>Locke needed no further urging. Important though the work of
    finding the antidote was, Eva's call was more imperative to
    him. He reassured her as best he could over the wire, for he
    had no idea what had really happened. Zita, as might have been
    expected, on her return to Brent Rock had been far too clever
    to disclose the exact truth that Flint had been abducted, and
    that while in her own charge.</p>

    <p>When she arrived at Brent Rock she had mounted by the same
    stairway by which she and Flint had departed. Entering Flint's
    room, she had raised the alarm and had acted her part so well
    that Eva thought that she had discovered Flint's absence at the
    precise moment at which Zita had cried out and she had come
    running in answer to her call.</p>

    <p>Locke gave Hadwell a brief outline of what had just occurred
    at Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>"Professor," he pleaded, "for Heaven's sake don't fail me.
    Try as you never tried before to find the antidote for this
    strange combination of poisons. Telephone me when you have
    it."</p>

    <p>Locke seized his hat, and Hadwell redoubled his efforts to
    fathom the toxic secret.</p>

    <p>At Brent Rock, in the mean time, everything was in
    confusion, Eva was almost distracted, and, to add to her
    discomfort, Paul took occasion to call.</p>

    <p>In the past few days her distrust of him, for she could call
    it by no other name, had grown, and the furtive glances which
    he exchanged with Zita, little trouble-maker, were not
    reassuring. But when Eva's maid, motioning her aside, told her
    that she had been a witness to the departure of Zita and Flint,
    Eva's suspicions from a vague misgiving became a stern reality.
    She longed for Locke's return and protection from the very man
    to whom she was engaged.</p>

    <p>As Locke left the chemist's he noticed a light runabout
    across the street, half hidden in the shadows. But he failed to
    notice the evil face of De Luxe Dora peering at him from
    beneath the rim of a well-pulled-down hat.</p>

    <p>"Huh!" she muttered. "We'll get his number and here's where
    I go after it."</p>

    <p>Locke hailed a passing taxicab, gave a hurried direction to
    the chauffeur, and jumped in. The taxi snorted, cut out open,
    and jumped forward as the driver clumsily shifted the worn
    gears. But out of the shadows there glided a low-hung runabout
    with a purling motor that without effort kept Locke's taxi just
    in sight without seeming to be following.</p>

    <p>At the time that the emissaries abducted Flint he had been
    roughly handled and some of his clothing had been torn. But as
    he had been incapable of the slightest degree of real
    self-defense, the thugs had soon desisted beating him up, with
    the result that he had escaped bodily injury except for a few
    slight scratches.</p>

    <p>The emissaries of the Automaton led him by devious winding
    paths down to the shore, and, half walking, half running,
    pressing close to the high cliffs, they urged him forward.</p>

    <p>Soon they came to a cleft in the rock, and, with one hand
    using a well-hooded electric torch to light the way, they
    dragged the poor unfortunate into the cave entrance to the
    den.</p>

    <p>This cave was a marvel of nature, hewn out of the solid rock
    by countless tides, its dome lost in the darkness. It gave an
    impression of immensity, while in many directions passageways
    gave off from what might be called a main chamber.</p>

    <p>Flint was roughly thrown on a rock, where, head in hands, he
    swayed backward and forward, now moaning, now chuckling, now
    laughing outright. The echo of that laugh resounded hollowly in
    the dismal place and must have notified the supreme master of
    this underground world that his domain had been invaded.</p>

    <p>A metallic clanging in the distance, as of struck anvils, a
    crunching, as the smaller rocks broke in twain under the
    enormous weight of the iron monster, then far, far down the
    passageway two points of fire&mdash;the eyes of the
    thing&mdash;and with arms swinging like flails, from out the
    passageway there stalked&mdash;the Automaton.</p>

    <p>Even the emissaries, slaves to this monster through fear,
    and seeing it often, fell back in awe and consternation, so
    terrible was its menace.</p>

    <p>It strode over to Flint and, pushing him backward, glared at
    him with burning eyes that seemed to search his soul. The
    monster then turned to one of the emissaries and, with a
    sweeping gesture, gave a command.</p>

    <p>The emissary understood and immediately ran up one of the
    passageways, returning in a few moments with a bottle which
    contained a purplish mixture. At another sign from the
    Automaton the emissary took a drinking-glass and poured out a
    portion of the purple fluid. Then he forced the draught between
    Flint's clenched teeth.</p>

    <p>A violent trembling shook Flint from head to foot, a shudder
    of so exhausting a nature that after the spasm Flint, weakened,
    reclined against the cold wall of the cave, his body in a
    clammy perspiration. But gradually there came a change in his
    dazed, mad eyes. The iris contracted and became more normal.
    Even the leaden hue of his face slowly passed away. The face
    muscles relaxed and gradually the light of reason appeared in
    his eyes.</p>

    <p>In a questioning manner Flint gazed about him. He saw the
    cave with its scintillating points of fire, as the man with the
    torch gesticulated. He saw the emissaries, and the realization
    that his position was perilous came to him. But it was only
    when he saw the towering form of the Automaton that his blood
    froze with horror and he made a frantic effort to escape the
    very thing which he had feared existed in Madagascar and had
    attempted to betray to Brent on the fatal night.</p>

    <p>It was useless. He was soon borne down by the thugs, who
    stationed two of their number to guard him. Seeing the utter
    hopelessness of any attempt to escape, Flint sat quietly, while
    his crafty mind schemed for some other plan. Suddenly he saw
    the bottle, the contents of which had restored his reason.
    Reaching out slyly, he turned it around until he could read the
    label, and then, even in his predicament, he exulted over his
    discovery. It was the antidote. Like a flash came to him a
    shrewd scheme to use the knowledge.</p>

    <p>An emissary who seemed to be a leader came over to him.</p>

    <p>"Flint," he snarled, "you get one chance&mdash;see? Beat it
    back to Brent Rock and see that you get that Brent girl to come
    to the place where we will turn you loose. Understand? If you
    fail it means death. Think it over."</p>

    <p>Flint could only agree.</p>

    <p>They bandaged his eyes and quickly led him back over the
    road by which they had come.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

    <p>Brent Rock was brilliantly lighted against Locke's coming.
    At the foot of the great stairway a group of excited servants
    had gathered, as if for mutual protection.</p>

    <p>"Not another day will I stay in this house," quavered the
    cook. "What with crazy laughing and the other carryings-on, I'm
    fair distracted."</p>

    <p>"Take shame to yerself, Mary Dolan, for yer gab of quittin',
    with the master and Miss Eva in sore trouble," answered the
    second girl. "But as you say," she continued, shaking her head,
    "it's a gloomy old place, and if it wasn't for Miss Eva I'd not
    be long in going myself."</p>

    <p>"'Ave you no loyalty?" asked the butler, turning on them
    both.</p>

    <p>"Hould yer jaw, Johnny Bull," threatened the cook. "Indade
    no foreigner can tell Mary Dolan her duty."</p>

    <p>So they wrangled back and forth, and the underlying cause of
    all the discord was the old one&mdash;fear.</p>

    <p>Nor was Eva exempt from its baneful influence. She was here,
    there, everywhere, allaying one servant's apprehension,
    commanding another to perform some task in order to occupy that
    servant's mind&mdash;but, for herself, she knew that the strain
    would not lessen until Locke arrived. She ran up-stairs and to
    a window from which she could obtain a better view of the drive
    along which he must come.</p>

    <p>In a very short time, which, nevertheless, seemed an age to
    her, Eva was rewarded, and she fairly flew down the stairs, out
    of the house, and far down the drive. Locke's taxi stopped, he
    leaped out, and, regardless of the chauffeur, took Eva's
    hand.</p>

    <p>"Tell me quickly what has happened?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>From a distance Dora was a witness, exulting.</p>

    <p>"Paul stands a swell chance with her," she sneered.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I'm so glad you're here," confided Eva, letting down
    just a bit of her restraint as, like a frightened child, she
    told of what she had learned about the disappearance of
    Flint.</p>

    <p>Locke dismissed the driver, and together they walked slowly
    toward the house.</p>

    <p>Not only Eva, but the entire household was relieved by
    Locke's presence. The cook rushed forward and, with a "God
    bless you, sir!" would have embraced him had he not stepped
    aside. Even the dignified old family butler tried to take his
    hand, an unheard-of liberty on his part. For, unknowingly, all
    had come suddenly to rely upon this quiet, unassuming young
    man.</p>

    <p>Locke immediately asked to be shown to Flint's room in the
    hope that Flint might have left some clue behind. But, although
    they searched high and low, no success met their efforts.</p>

    <p>It was then that they faced their darkest moment. Feeling,
    as they did, that they were encircled by hidden enemies, the
    very air they breathed became a menace. Every attempt to find
    the thread that might unravel the dark mystery proved futile.
    It was not to be wondered at that they despaired. Even the
    weird laughter of Eva's stricken father, echoing hollowly
    through the house, seemed to be mocking their efforts.</p>

    <p>The Automaton's emissaries were anxious to do their job and
    return to the cave, for, like rats, they preferred the security
    best found underground. They did not lead Flint very far.</p>

    <p>At the edge of the Brent estate there was an Italian marble
    fountain decorated with bronze dolphins and water-nymphs
    disporting themselves. It was at this fountain that the men
    halted Flint and, with a final warning, left him.</p>

    <p>For a few moments, such was his fear, Flint did not remove
    the bandage from his eyes, but moved groping around until his
    hand came in contact with the edge of the fountain. For a
    moment he stood quietly, listening for sounds of the
    emissaries. Then, as he heard nothing, he tore the bandage from
    his eyes, gazed wonderingly around him until his mind grasped
    his exact location, then, with a bound, started to run toward
    Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>Had he noticed the bestial face of an emissary peering from
    the shrubbery he would have been even more frightened.
    Retribution, he would have known, would be swift and sure had
    he disregarded their commands and moved in another
    direction.</p>

    <p>As Flint left the fountain Balcom, suave and well groomed as
    usual, was just giving his hat and stick to the butler when
    Locke and Eva, returning from Flint's room, encountered him in
    the hallway.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Mr. Balcom," exclaimed Eva, "Mr. Locke and I are at a
    loss to account for Mr. Flint's disappearance! I told the
    gardeners, and they have hunted for him all over the estate and
    beyond, but he has disappeared as completely as though the
    ground had swallowed him."</p>

    <p>Balcom expressed his utmost astonishment and at once
    insisted on going to Flint's room to solve the mystery
    himself.</p>

    <p>Eva and Locke went directly into the library, where Locke
    for the first time had an opportunity to tell Eva the result of
    his visit to the chemist. The fact that they had discovered the
    nature of the toxin was in itself encouraging, and Eva felt
    that, even now, she could see the glimmer of a silver lining to
    the clouds.</p>

    <p>"If we can only locate Mr. Flint, Quentin," she murmured, "I
    feel that much would be explained."</p>

    <p>Hardly had the words passed her lips when, breathless and
    disheveled, Flint staggered up the stairs from under the
    porte-cochère and into the hallway. Balcom, just descending
    from his brief inspection of Flint's room, hailed him.</p>

    <p>"What has happened?" he demanded. "Don't go into the
    library."</p>

    <p>"I've just escaped from the Automaton," shouted Flint, "and
    I've found the antidote!"</p>

    <p>Before Balcom could stop him he rushed into the library,
    Balcom following in a towering rage. Eva gave a startled little
    cry at the wild intrusion and Locke moved closer to her.</p>

    <p>"Is the antidote that will restore your father's reason
    worth ten thousand dollars to you?" demanded Flint; then,
    before Eva could reply, added: "Speak quick! I've got to get
    out of the country to-night."</p>

    <p>"Ten thousand!" gasped Eva. "Ten times ten thousand! Tell me
    what it is."</p>

    <p>"Show me the money first," haggled Flint, "and remember I
    must have the hard cash."</p>

    <p>"Just a moment, Eva," interrupted Locke. "Consider this
    thing well. We can deal with this fellow as a final
    resort."</p>

    <p>Eva looked from Locke to Balcom, her mind in a turmoil, as
    the telephone-bell rang and Locke hurried to answer it.</p>

    <p>In the room now there was a conflict of emotions and desires
    that fairly electrified the place. Eva ardently craved her
    father's recovery at all costs. Flint's avaricious mind wavered
    between a scheme nearing success and the possibility of failure
    and the fear of the Automaton. Balcom strained to hear the
    purport of the message that Locke was receiving.</p>

    <p>At the sound of the chemist's voice Locke was tense with
    suppressed excitement.</p>

    <p>"I've found the antidote," hastened to report the
    professor.</p>

    <p>With a cordial word of thanks Locke turned from the
    telephone and faced the group in the room. As he made the
    announcement, Eva almost embraced him in the flood of relief at
    the thought of her father restored.</p>

    <p>"Eva," growled Balcom, "you forget yourself. As Paul's
    father, I cannot countenance such actions."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Balcom," interrupted Locke, "I am sure you will be kind
    in your criticism of Miss Brent. She has merely overrated my
    service to her."</p>

    <p>"Paul shall hear of this," stormed Balcom.</p>

    <p>"If your son cares to take the matter up with me," returned
    Locke, now on his dignity, "I am always to be
    found&mdash;here."</p>

    <p>"Never mind," interposed Flint, who feared to see his chance
    slipping, "I've got to get out of the country. Mr. Locke, your
    antidote is probably valueless; mine is the certain one. Look
    at me, Miss Brent. Am I not cured?"</p>

    <p>"You miserable sneak," scowled Locke, stepping over to him,
    "we don't need your assistance now."</p>

    <p>"I'm dealing with Miss Brent," insisted Flint,
    insolently.</p>

    <p>Eva, a bit nervous over Balcom's overbearing manner,
    interposed. "Mr. Locke," she said, with just a touch of dignity
    for effect on Balcom, "this is a matter of life and death, and
    I am not in favor of permitting a proven antidote to be taken
    out of the country by this&mdash;this man. I have every
    confidence in you, but suppose&mdash;just suppose&mdash;that
    your chemist friend is mistaken."</p>

    <p>Flint immediately saw his advantage and pressed it home.
    "Are you going to let ten thousand dollars stand in the way of
    your father's recovery?" he insinuated. "Here," he added,
    taking pencil and paper from his pocket and writing
    hurriedly.</p>

    <p>"Baker's dock," Eva read, as he handed her the paper, "until
    five o'clock."</p>

    <p>Flint bowed decently enough to her, glanced upward, and, as
    he thought of Eva's father lying stricken with the Madagascar
    madness in the room above, an evil leer came over his fox-like
    face. As he left he completely ignored both Locke and Balcom,
    unless it was that the look in his eyes meant a sort of
    sinister triumph.</p>

    <p>Locke followed him out of the library, and for a few moments
    Eva and Balcom were alone.</p>

    <p>Balcom had been quick to realize that it would not further
    his plans if he continued to antagonize this high-spirited
    girl. He took another course. The kind and fatherly manner
    which he could assume so readily was now apparent.</p>

    <p>"Eva, my dear child," he ingratiated, "I am really sorry for
    the hasty way in which I spoke, but, aside from our duty to
    International Patents, your marriage to my son has been my
    greatest hope and ambition."</p>

    <p>"I can't see why you should wish a daughter-in-law of whose
    actions you disapprove," retorted Eva, pointedly.</p>

    <p>It was a facer for Balcom and he quickly guided the
    conversation into less dangerous channels.</p>

    <p>Eva's candid nature could not comprehend treachery of any
    kind in others, and yet, although she was unable to put a name
    to it, she had a vague feeling of insecurity in dealing with
    her father's partner. This feeling had been heightened by
    Balcom's actions. In speaking of the proposed marriage to Paul
    he had come quite close to her. She shuddered, for, out of the
    corner of her eye, only a few moments before, she remembered
    him in the same position when Flint had handed her the address,
    and she knew that Balcom had surreptitiously read it. Why had
    he taken that underhand method when, if he had only asked
    frankly to see the paper, she would have handed it to him
    without hesitation or suspicion.</p>

    <p>Eva started to leave the library, but Balcom stopped her
    with a gesture. "My dear," he said, "your father is stricken
    with a deadly malady. His affairs are in your hands to protect
    his interests. I must urge that you marry Paul at the earliest
    possible moment."</p>

    <p>Eva scarcely knew what to say. "I can't," she blurted out,
    then tried to cover her confusion and made it worse,
    "only&mdash;as a last resort&mdash;to save my
    father&mdash;Oh&mdash;good-by!" And she almost ran from the
    room.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

    <p>Meanwhile, as Flint left Brent Rock, his fear of the
    Automaton returned to him with redoubled force. He had been
    false to his mission. Nor had he even succeeded in his
    treachery. A few minutes he had been certain that Eva would
    come to Baker's dock at the time set, but now doubts began to
    assail him. With her obvious faith in Locke, she might decide
    on the chemist's antidote, and there was always a possibility
    that it might restore Brent, in which case Flint realized that
    his life would be forfeit to the Automaton.</p>

    <p>Nor were his fears unfounded. He had barely passed the
    fountain where, half an hour before, he had been set free, when
    an emissary came out from behind a neighboring tree and took up
    his trail.</p>

    <p>De Luxe Dora also had waited only long enough to see Eva and
    Locke enter Brent Rock, when she turned her runabout around and
    drove rapidly back to Professor Hadwell's. She arrived there
    just in time to meet an automobile coming from the opposite
    direction and containing three emissaries of the Automaton.</p>

    <p>In answer to an inquiry, Dora pointed out the chemist's
    house to them. They piled out, and their leader knocked at the
    door, while Dora drove off.</p>

    <p>The chemist answered, and the leader produced a vial, glibly
    lying as he handed it over.</p>

    <p>"The Williams Drug Company sent me to have this stuff
    analyzed," said the leader. "I'll wait."</p>

    <p>As the professor admitted him he did not see the other two
    men pressed close to the wall on either side of the door. The
    moment the professor's back was turned they slinked after their
    leader into the house. In a dark corner of the hallway they
    crouched as their leader went into the laboratory with the
    chemist.</p>

    <p>The professor sniffed at the vial, which contained nothing
    but pure water, and in surprise turned to the emissary for an
    explanation. But it was too late. The emissary dealt him a blow
    with a blunt instrument that stunned him and, as he reeled back
    and grasped at a table, the other thugs rushed from the hall
    and rained blow after blow on his venerable head and beat him
    to the floor. A convulsive shudder&mdash;a long-drawn-out
    sigh&mdash;and he lay still.</p>

    <p>With barely a glance at him the emissaries set to work to
    smash all the paraphernalia of the place, sparing nothing in
    order to make sure that the antidote would be destroyed. Glass
    tubes, retorts, bottles, even furniture were smashed to bits in
    their orgy of ruin&mdash;and there, in the midst of the debris,
    his life's work finished, lay the old chemist, dead.</p>

    <p>Tiring of their own efforts, the murderers at last desisted.
    One of them went to the street door and peered out, but in a
    moment was back with the others.</p>

    <p>"Quick&mdash;that fellow Locke is coming."</p>

    <p>He was right. Locke had immediately quit Brent Rock and had
    come directly to the chemist's in the hope of forestalling any
    further attempt by Flint to inveigle Eva into dealing with
    him.</p>

    <p>The door had been left ajar and, although he thought it
    strange, Locke was without suspicion and entered the hallway.
    He called to his old friend, but the dead lips could not answer
    and the emissaries would not.</p>

    <p>Greatly alarmed now, Locke strode to the laboratory. For a
    moment he stood as though petrified as the horrid scene burst
    upon his vision. He ran to the chemist and knelt beside his
    battered body.</p>

    <p>With a rush the emissaries darted from their hiding-place
    and were upon him.</p>

    <p>Although taken unawares, Locke was, in a measure, ready for
    them. One he grabbed in a clever jiu-jitsu hold and sent him
    hurtling through the air to crash in a heap in a far corner of
    the room. Leaping to his feet, he beat another to the floor.
    The third villain was of tougher fiber. Up and down the
    laboratory they battled, stumbling over broken furniture, now
    falling to the floor, where they rolled over and over, first
    one, then the other gaining the mastery, while the broken glass
    with which the floor was littered cut their clothing to ribbons
    and bit into their flesh.</p>

    <p>Locke was slowly gaining the upper hand when the thug whom
    he had thrown over his head recovered. The brute took the
    situation in at a glance, saw his pal in trouble, and, sneaking
    treacherously behind Locke, dealt him a terrific blow with the
    butt of a revolver. Locke dropped to the floor as if pole-axed
    and lay still.</p>

    <p>One of the thugs kicked him as he lay defenseless, and then,
    spying a row of coat-hooks in an inner hallway, with fiendish
    ingenuity directed the others who had joined him. They strung
    Locke up by his thumbs so that he hung, half suspended, with
    his toes just off the floor.</p>

    <p>As one of them searched him Locke was still unconscious.
    They found nothing but a few bank-notes and the automatic
    revolver that Locke always carried.</p>

    <p>Slowly Locke regained his senses. The agony of his strained
    thumbs was almost unbearable. But he was not the man to give
    up.</p>

    <p>By this time two of the emissaries had gone, leaving one,
    who seated himself quite close to Locke, where he was examining
    the revolver. With the stoicism of an Indian, Locke manfully
    tried to evolve a plan by which he might escape. Like a flash
    it came to him, but it was a plan so fraught with the
    possibility of failure that he would not have decided on it
    except for the agony of the strain on his thumbs.</p>

    <p>Directly opposite him and at a distance of four or five feet
    was a door leading to a back alley. This door the emissary now
    guarding him had locked as a precaution against surprise and
    had carefully placed the key in his vest pocket.</p>

    <p>Locke weighed each detail of his plan and then, bracing his
    feet firmly against the wall, he suddenly shot his lower limbs
    forward and, like the closing of a pair of giant shears, he
    wrapped his legs about the neck of the emissary and immediately
    exerted enormous pressure with his knees.</p>

    <p>The emissary, taken totally by surprise, struggled to break
    the hold, and Locke's thumbs were almost wrenched from their
    sockets. But he held on grimly. Soon the thug's struggles
    subsided, Locke released him, and he slipped to the floor.</p>

    <p>Locke was wearing a low-cut shoe. Strange that a man's life
    may hinge on such a slight detail, but this fact enabled him to
    work off his right shoe and his sock. He extended his bare
    foot, and with his toes searched the pocket of the emissary for
    the key to the door. Finally he found it.</p>

    <p>Locke held the key as firmly as he might between his toes
    and, projecting his body by a muscular effort far away from the
    wall, he managed to insert the key in the lock. He turned it.
    The door was unlocked now. A swift downward movement of his
    foot against the knob and the door swung open.</p>

    <p>He braced himself against its edge and, with his back firmly
    pressed against the wall, relieved the strain on his thumbs. He
    rested a moment and then, as it were, walked up the edge of the
    door until his feet reached the top. Swinging one leg over the
    door, by patient effort he was enabled to release one swollen
    thumb, then the other. An instant later he dropped down and
    leaned exhaustedly against the wall.</p>

    <p>While Locke was held in the room things had happened which
    would have set him nearly crazy with anxiety. Eva, having heard
    nothing from him, had become alarmed and had telephoned to the
    chemist. This was at quarter to five, and she had supposed that
    it was the chemist who answered her. In reality it had been an
    emissary, and he had told her that the final experiment to find
    an antidote for her father's malady had been really a failure
    and that Locke had left some time before.</p>

    <p>After all that she had endured, this was almost the final
    blow to Eva. She thought of Flint and Baker's dock and five
    o'clock. There was no time to lose if she were to save her
    father. So she pulled herself together, seized her hat and
    cloak, and started for the door.</p>

    <p>Here Zita stopped her and offered to accompany her, but she
    declined. She hastily asked the direction of Baker's dock from
    the butler, and then ran out of the house and sprang to the
    steering-wheel of her waiting car. With a whir of the starter
    she was away.</p>

    <p>Flint had arrived at the dock long before and was now
    slinking in and out among the crates and boxes as he sought
    diligently for a safe hiding-place. But his nerves, none too
    strong at the best, were now running riot, and nowhere could he
    feel a sense of security so that he could remain quiet.</p>

    <p>It was while he was sneaking from one pile of bales to
    another that an emissary hailed him.</p>

    <p>"Are you Flint?" he demanded.</p>

    <p>"Y-e-s," came quaveringly from Flint.</p>

    <p>"Well, there's a lady in the office asking for you."</p>

    <p>Such was the fascination of any of the emissaries of the
    Automaton over Flint by this time that he followed the man
    without question, particularly as he felt that he would be
    spared, since the lady in the office could be none other than
    Eva.</p>

    <p>Together they walked toward the entrance and, with an order
    to wait, the emissary halted Flint close to a pile of crates
    and left him. Flint dared not move. A premonition of impending
    disaster must have come over him, for his knees shook and a
    clammy sweat broke out on his forehead.</p>

    <p>Without sound a gigantic iron hand and arm protruded from
    behind a crate and, for a moment, hung suspended over Flint's
    head. Then, with a swift encircling movement, that hooklike arm
    wrapped itself around Flint's neck and drew him into the
    shadow. The mighty form drew the victim close&mdash;and it was
    over.</p>

    <p>The Automaton picked up the body as though it had been a
    mere feather-weight and stalked out to the waiting emissaries.
    A trap-door was opened and Flint's body was dashed into the
    river. Thus it was that all his scheming came to an end and his
    secret from Madagascar, which he had told Brent, but which now
    lay locked in that mad-man's mind, was stilled with Flint's
    dead lips.</p>

    <p>At the chemist's shop Locke was by this time recovering from
    the terrible ordeal through which he had passed. He bathed his
    swollen thumbs, and by rubbing them was able somewhat to
    restore the circulation. Then he stepped to the telephone and
    gave the Brent Rock number.</p>

    <p>It was Zita who answered him.</p>

    <p>"Eva has gone alone to Baker's dock," she answered to his
    inquiry, in half-triumphant jealousy.</p>

    <p>Locke did not wait to hear more. There was not a moment to
    be lost. He rushed out, disheveled as he was, into the street,
    slamming the door after him. It seemed hours before he could
    find a taxicab.</p>

    <p>"Baker's dock!" he yelled. "And twenty dollars if you make
    it in ten minutes."</p>

    <p>He did not know that the emissaries had robbed him of
    everything, nor would it have made any difference, for he could
    easily have fixed it with the driver through his police and
    Secret Service connections.</p>

    <p>In the mean time Eva's car had met with misfortune, and she
    had been compelled to stop. She jumped out and busied herself
    with a missing cylinder.</p>

    <p>Locke's taxi was running smoothly and arrived at the dock
    well within the time he had ordered. Locke jumped out and
    started to pay. It was then that he discovered that he was
    without money. The driver became angry and hard to pacify with
    the story of the robbery, but Locke finally convinced him that
    all was right with the Department of Justice.</p>

    <p>Locke walked through the gates to the dock and for a moment
    stood nonplussed. This dock had none of the turmoil and bustle
    naturally associated with docks when a steamer is about to
    leave.</p>

    <p>He cautiously proceeded between the piles of merchandise
    toward the end of the wharf. Of one thing he was now certain
    and a prayer of relief came to his lips. He was there before
    Eva and able to guard her from any danger that might arise.</p>

    <p>His eyes were keen, but he failed to notice the emissaries
    who, from behind crates and bales, were watching his every
    move. Nor did he see that fiend of iron, the Automaton, which,
    standing rigid, glared at him from behind an enormous
    packing-case.</p>

    <p>He continued down the wharf as, slinking like coyotes, those
    sinister forms glided from hiding-place to hiding-place and
    were never far from his heels. He reached the end of the wharf
    and gazed up and down the dark river. Here and there he could
    distinguish the colored lights that marked a tugboat or some
    other small craft, but of a large steamer there was no sign. It
    is rarely that a boat warps into a dock just a few moments
    before leaving for foreign parts, and it flashed upon Locke's
    mind that Flint had deceived them about his leaving for
    Madagascar that night.</p>

    <p>He was still wondering what it could all mean when the
    emissaries leaped upon him. Although weakened by his previous
    battle, Locke proved no easy customer for them. Time after time
    he struggled free from them and with arms working like
    piston-rods for a while he kept them at a distance. But, like a
    pack of wolves, they were not to be denied, and they finally
    succeeded in holding him firmly.</p>

    <p>One of them brought leg-irons which he snapped around
    Locke's ankles. Once again Locke managed to get one of his arms
    free and, before they could prevent him, two emissaries lay
    prostrate on the wharf. But that effort marked his last, for
    the Automaton, stalking up behind him, pinioned his arms as
    though he was a baby.</p>

    <p>An emissary now placed a pair of handcuffs on his wrists
    and, to bind him more securely, fastened a chain that extended
    from the handcuffs to the leg-irons.</p>

    <p>Two of the thugs now carried him to the edge of the wharf,
    while a third attached a heavy weight to Locke's feet. Locke
    realized his helplessness, realized that his death was
    imminent. But he determined to rid the world of at least one
    murderer. By a mighty effort he shook off his captors and, as
    one rushed forward, he grabbed him in his manacled hands and
    leaped with him into the river as they grappled.</p>

    <p>At the shore end of the wharf an emissary was leading Eva,
    as she thought, to Flint.</p>

    <p>Locke and the thug sank immediately to the bottom of the
    river and, under water, there ensued a terrific battle. Locke,
    semi-helpless because of his shakles, had the greatest
    difficulty in preventing the thug from breaking loose. But he
    was determined that the fellow at least would pay for his
    crimes with his life.</p>

    <p>The thug's struggles gradually became more feeble. Air
    bubbles rose from his bestial lips and he became limp in
    Locke's grasp. Locke released him and, feet first, he floated
    upward, dead.</p>

    <p>Locke's lungs were almost bursting now as he struggled at
    his chains; his senses reeled; he thought of Eva, and redoubled
    his efforts. If he could only get rid of that great weight that
    was holding him down. A singing came in his ears.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

    <p>As Eva hurried down the dock, looking for the renegade,
    Flint she found herself cornered between the emissary and the
    terrible Automaton himself. With a scream of terror she ran
    until she came to a door that divided the dock into fireproof
    sections. Through it she darted, the Automaton following
    relentlessly.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Locke, his lungs almost bursting and the blood
    surging to his head, had managed to free himself from his
    shackles and had floated to the surface of the water. As he
    came up he swam to the piles of the dock just as several
    boatmen saw him and hurried to his aid.</p>

    <p>They heard the screams of Eva, and all started running up
    the dock, but not in time to capture the Automaton, who, warned
    by the emissaries, crashed through the side of the dock house
    nearest the shore and escaped.</p>

    <p>A moment later Locke, searching through the piles of boxes,
    bales, and crates, found Eva, just recovering from her fright,
    and in the joy of having saved her by his timely return forgot,
    for the moment, to pursue the terrible villain, who managed to
    reach a waiting closed car and was whisked away.</p>

    <p>Thus it was that after their return to Brent Rock, on the
    following day Eva was ministering to her father, still
    hopelessly insane through the failure to discover the antidote
    to the madness.</p>

    <p>While Eva was engaged in her ministrations up-stairs Locke
    was finishing some experiment in his laboratory. Down-stairs,
    Balcom had just arrived in the hall, where he was met by Zita
    with a report of what had happened the day before.</p>

    <p>"Tell it to me in the strong-room while I place this package
    there," Balcom whispered, indicating the package which he had
    brought.</p>

    <p>Together Balcom and Zita descended to the cellar and made
    their way to the Graveyard of Genius as Zita poured forth her
    story, unmindful of the fact that the butler had seen them go
    down and was watching very skeptically. In the Graveyard Balcom
    unwrapped a small model of a motor and placed it on the
    shelf.</p>

    <p>Eva, having left her father, came upon Locke in the hall,
    and there they stood talking for a moment, when the butler
    approached apologetically.</p>

    <p>"Begging your pardon, Miss Brent," he reported, "but I just
    saw Mr. Balcom go down to the strong-room with Miss Zita, and I
    thought you might like to know."</p>

    <p>"Thank you," nodded Eva, dismissing the butler and trying to
    show no concern in the matter.</p>

    <p>But Locke shot a quick glance at her as the servant left,
    and it was evident that both felt the same suspicion, for Locke
    immediately excused himself and hurried down-stairs.</p>

    <p>In the Graveyard Balcom and Zita were talking in subdued
    tones as Zita whispered.</p>

    <p>"I suppose you know," she nodded, "that before Mr. Brent
    went mad he wrote a confession with a list of these inventions
    which International Patents has suppressed?"</p>

    <p>Balcom could scarcely conceal his rage. "Yes, I know it," he
    replied, savagely. "That confession would cause a great deal of
    trouble."</p>

    <p>Low as they were talking, they would have been even more
    careful had they known that Locke was listening outside and
    that, even as they turned to leave the strong-room, he had
    sidled out of the way and was rejoining Eva in the library.</p>

    <p>Locke had scarcely told Eva what he had heard when she moved
    over to the safe and would have tried to open it had he not
    stopped her. For he had heard the other two coming from the
    cellar, and even as it was they were at the hall door.</p>

    <p>"My dear," remarked Balcom as he entered and went to Eva,
    "since your father is not likely to recover, I must ask you to
    transfer all the company papers from his private safe to the
    office of the company."</p>

    <p>Eva did not respond to the fatherly manner assumed by
    Balcom. Instead she almost point-blank refused to do as he had
    requested.</p>

    <p>Just then Locke, whom Balcom had almost ignored up to the
    present, heard the noise of some one coming through the
    conservatory. It was Paul Balcom, his coat on his arm, his
    sleeves rolled up, and a tennis-racquet in his hand, as he had
    come just from the courts.</p>

    <p>Paul glanced surlily at Locke, who bowed pleasantly to him,
    as well he might, considering their relative positions in Eva's
    real affections. Catching sight of his father with Eva, Paul
    paused a moment.</p>

    <p>It was just at that instant that Balcom had been saying to
    her: "Why don't you marry Paul, as you promised your father and
    me? That would settle all the difficulties."</p>

    <p>Paul had suspected the nature of the conversation, though he
    approached as if ignorant of it. Apparently catching the drift,
    he deftly urged her, but Eva tactfully changed the subject,
    greatly to Paul's chagrin and his father's ill-suppressed
    anger.</p>

    <p>The suspense of the situation was relieved for Eva by the
    nearer approach of Locke, who must have had some inkling of
    what was going on. Paul and his father exchanged glances as the
    young chemist and detective joined Eva, and it was evident that
    no love toward him was wasted by either.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me," she apologized, walking away with Locke, "but
    there is something very important that I must attend to for my
    father's interests."</p>

    <p>Locke and Eva walked to the safe, while Balcom and Paul
    watched like hawks.</p>

    <p>A moment later Eva was kneeling before the safe, after
    giving Locke a paper which contained the combination numbers to
    open the bolts. Locke glanced at it, then held it where Eva
    could read:</p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Combination of
    Safe</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Turn once left to
    40</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Three right to 18</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Once left to 40</span><br />


    <p>As Locke held the paper and Eva's slender hand spun the
    combination lock, Balcom and Paul moved silently forward.
    Although Locke was holding the paper with the combinations for
    Eva, he heard them come up behind him and knew that they were
    watching. With a quiet smile to himself he moved the paper over
    so that they could see it, nor were they slow to take advantage
    of the chance. Locke's mind was working fast, and he had a
    purpose in what seemed to be carelessness or even
    foolishness.</p>

    <p>A moment later Eva opened the safe and from it she took a
    typewritten document of many pages.</p>

    <p>It read:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="smcap">Board Of Directors,</p>

        <p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">International Patents,
        Inc.,</span><br />
         <span style="margin-left: 3em;">New York.</span></p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;In view of
        the government's anti-trust investigation, I have prepared
        this list of inventions we have suppressed. I think we
        should discuss at our annual meeting the advisability of
        surrendering our rights to these inventions, no matter what
        may happen to the corporations we have been protecting.</p>

        <p class="center">Very truly yours,</p>

        <p class="author">Peter Brent.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Following this letter was a bulky paper, or rather set of
    papers, which detailed the inventions and their history,
    exposing some of the nefarious operations of the
    corporation.</p>

    <p>Balcom, as he read the top letter, showed great agitation.
    As Locke took the package from Eva, Balcom interrupted:</p>

    <p>"That's very dangerous," he said. "If it gets out, the
    corporations are ruined."</p>

    <p>Locke scarcely replied. Instead, he very ostentatiously
    replaced the document in the safe, refusing to intrust it
    either to Balcom or to Paul, who withdrew sullenly, leaving Eva
    alone with Locke in the library as Locke whirled the
    combination of the closed safe door.</p>

    <p>It was perhaps half an hour later in the secret den of the
    Automaton in the rock-hewn foundation of Brent Rock that the
    emissaries were watching the arched and dark passage. Suddenly
    there was the warning clank, and the huge steel monster strode
    in.</p>

    <p>For some time he stood before the table, giving his
    instructions by means of mysterious, cryptic motions.</p>

    <p>Meantime, above in Brent Rock, Locke had been busy, for he
    had conceived an entirely new plan to capture the Automaton. It
    was nothing short of an electric trap, and deadly in its
    simplicity.</p>

    <p>From the wall switch Locke had led wires carrying the house
    current. Already, also, he had let Eva in on his secret plan,
    and she was all eagerness as he planted his trap.</p>

    <p>Before the safe, now, Locke paused, and there for a moment
    twisted the combination so that he could get his correct
    position. That done, he noted the place where he had been
    standing, and removed a mat from the floor in front of the
    safe. At that place he set in on the floor a fairly large iron
    plate. To this iron plate he attached a wire, then replaced the
    rug, but in such a way that a part of the plate was exposed,
    though it would never be noticed.</p>

    <p>"If the Automaton attempts to open the safe," he remarked to
    Eva, as he worked, "he will complete the electric circuit and
    it will hold him until we capture him."</p>

    <p>"How clever!" Eva exclaimed, involuntarily.</p>

    <p>"Now for making my signaling connection to the laboratory,"
    continued Locke. "Then I must get some of my men up here from
    the department."</p>

    <p>However, while Locke and Eva were busy arranging this
    electric trap, they did not notice that they were being watched
    by Zita, who had stolen into the conservatory and was eying
    them eagerly from the protection of the fronds of a palm. Zita,
    moreover, was greatly excited, as she gathered with her quick
    perception just what it was that they were doing. Nor did she
    wait to see the work finished, but stole out of the door and
    away hurriedly.</p>

    <p>Locke had finished his preparations, and as he and Eva were
    discussing the possibilities of what he had devised, he
    remarked, in answer to her eager inquiry about his suspicions,
    "I am sure we shall prove that there is a man inside the
    terrible machine that attacks us."</p>

    <p>"Then you don't think it is really an automaton?" asked Eva,
    with great respect for Locke's opinion, though it was
    sufficiently in evidence that she was not at all convinced that
    the monster was not really of steel and controlled by something
    that resembled a human brain.</p>

    <p>Locke was non-committal. "This trap will tell us," was all
    that he would say.</p>

    <p>Zita, hurrying out from the conservatory, and wishing to
    waste not an instant in notifying Balcom, sought a near-by
    telephone pay-station, and there in frantic haste she demanded
    Balcom's number.</p>

    <p>It was some moments before Central could make the
    connection, and then it was only to Zita's disappointment and
    growing fear. The Madagascan servant of Balcom answered in the
    absence of his master.</p>

    <p>"Is Mr. Balcom there?" asked Zita, adding, "Or Mr.
    Paul?"</p>

    <p>The black shook his head. "Neither Mr. Balcom nor Mr. Paul
    is at home," he replied.</p>

    <p>Zita was now thoroughly alarmed. Had she some connection
    with the Automaton? Or was it her fear that either Balcom or
    Paul might know more than they would care to have the
    authorities know? Or was the Automaton really an iron monster,
    after all?</p>

    <p>That and many other questions were surging through the minds
    of all who had encountered this unique mystery.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

    <p>It was midnight when, far down in the rock-hewn cavern in
    which the Automaton had his secret den, the steel monster and
    one of his men stalked out through the arched passage that led
    to the very cellar of the house above them.</p>

    <p>A few moments later the swinging rock door in the Graveyard
    of Genius tilted and the two entered the strong-room, passing
    across the room and out through the steel door into the cellar.
    Up the cellar steps they proceeded until they reached the hall,
    then noiselessly they crossed into the library. With his human
    companion the monster approached the safe deliberately. Just as
    deliberately the Automaton reached out to turn the handle of
    the combination.</p>

    <p>There was a flash as the current passed through the arm of
    steel to the foot of steel resting on the plate Locke had set
    in the floor. A suppressed cry escaped from the henchman. As
    for the monster, he strove with superhuman force to wrench
    himself away from the electric trap.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, up in his laboratory in the house, Locke and four
    men from the Department of Justice had been waiting.</p>

    <p>"The Department expects us to get this evidence
    <i>right</i>," he had emphasized as he gave them their
    instructions.</p>

    <p>Hardly had he finished when a signal light which Locke had
    arranged on the wall flashed, giving the information that the
    trap had worked.</p>

    <p>Out of the laboratory all piled, running down the hall,
    Locke paused only a second to tap on Eva's door, as she had
    asked, if anything happened, so that she might be present at
    the capture. An instant and Eva, too, had joined the
    pursuit.</p>

    <p>Down in the library the Automaton struggled with the
    current. As the rug was kicked aside, the emissary saw the wire
    from the plate and quickly traced it to its source.</p>

    <p>The result was that in a few seconds the emissary had found
    a wall switch and pulled it. Instantly the Automaton was
    released from the power that held him.</p>

    <p>Quickly the man of steel raised and lowered his arms, as
    though to be sure that he could do so, at the same time
    indicating orders to his follower, who leaped to guard the
    entrance to the room. Then the Automaton turned to open the
    safe, making swift use of the remaining seconds before the
    alarm might bring interference.</p>

    <p>In almost no time he had the safe open, reached in, and
    seized a packet of precious papers, apparently. Then he turned
    and was gone, regardless of the man whom he had sent to guard
    him.</p>

    <p>In the hall, Locke's sharp ears had detected the approach of
    the emissary. Not knowing whether it might be the villain
    himself, he cautioned the men to wait an instant. The emissary,
    coming along, crouching and listening, did not see Locke, and
    thus Locke was able to seize him and with a spectacular throw
    project him literally into the hands of the law in the person
    of one of his own men, who snapped the bracelets on the
    astonished thug as Locke, followed by Eva and the rest, ran on
    to the library.</p>

    <p>No one was in the library as Locke ran in and looked about.
    He turned toward the door to the hallway where the portières
    were drawn. As he was standing there, looking about, the
    portières moved behind him. Suddenly they were jerked aside
    from their fastenings and flung over his head. As this
    happened, the ponderous hand of the Automaton descended on
    Locke's head and he sank to the floor as the portières wrapped
    about him.</p>

    <p>When the department agents with Eva arrived, they were
    merely in time to untangle Locke from the curtains. The
    Automaton had fled safely.</p>

    <p>Although his head was still reeling from the blow, Locke
    started to question the prisoner, but gave it up as a bad job
    and hurried over to examine the safe, followed by Eva.</p>

    <p>Their dismay was mutual. Not only was the safe door open,
    but the paper was gone.</p>

    <p>Question the emissary as they would, they could get nothing
    out of him. Such men have keenly developed the gang instinct of
    silence. They would sooner die than squeal.</p>

    <p>Even a night in jail failed to break the reticence of the
    emissary, although he had been subjected to the most strenuous
    third degree.</p>

    <p>Not only had his spirit not been broken, but the fellow was
    keenly alert and planning a way to secure his own release.</p>

    <p>As a prison guard was taking the emissary back to his cell,
    after a thorough quizzing by Locke in the warden's office, the
    emissary whispered:</p>

    <p>"Want to make a piece of change&mdash;safe?"</p>

    <p>The guard looked about, saw that the coast was clear to
    speak, but before he could do so the emissary spoke again.</p>

    <p>"Give me a piece of paper and a pencil."</p>

    <p>Quickly the thug scratched away at a note.</p>

    <p>"Deliver that," he said to the guard, handing him the note
    he had written, "and you'll get something worth while."</p>

    <p>The guard nodded as he shoved the thug into his cell and
    locked the door, then walked off, while the fellow watched
    eagerly through the bars.</p>

    <p>Locke in the warden's office, unsuccessful in making the
    prisoner talk, had evolved another scheme.</p>

    <p>"Put me in the cell next to him," decided Locke. "I have a
    plan."</p>

    <p>It was while the false guard was reading the address on the
    note that Locke and the warden entered the cell row. The guard
    hastily stuffed the message in his pocket as Locke and the
    warden passed up toward the empty next cell.</p>

    <p>Locke went through all the actions of one who was being
    thrown into a cell, and the emissary in his own cell listened
    without suspecting anything. Locke had arranged with the warden
    to leave the cell unlocked, but no sooner had the warden left
    than the guard, who had been observing, moved over and shot the
    bolts.</p>

    <p>Here, then, was a predicament. Locke could not give the
    alarm without putting the emissary in the next cell on guard.
    Rapidly Locke revolved in his head scheme after scheme. He was
    an expert on bolts and knew that at any moment he could release
    himself. Should he do so now? Instead he concluded to wait
    until the guard returned, for by the man's actions Locke was
    sure that something queer was going on, although, naturally, he
    did not know what it was. Accordingly Locke lay down on the
    bunk in the cell and decided to wait.</p>

    <p>Some time later, at a deserted house not far from the
    rock-hewn den of the Automaton, the false prison guard might
    have been seen delivering the message which the prisoner had
    written to two other emissaries of the Automaton.</p>

    <p>After a hasty conference they decided on their course of
    action. Not only did he receive the money the prisoner had
    promised him, but the emissaries gave him minute instructions
    regarding the rescue which they planned. A cap and a pair of
    goggles for the prisoner were given to the guard and he was
    sent on his way.</p>

    <p>Scarcely had he gone when the Automaton himself entered the
    deserted house, and under his direction one of the emissaries
    wrote a note which he addressed to Eva. For, with Locke out of
    the way, it was a splendid time to take advantage of the poor
    girl.</p>

    <p>The note read simply: "Our prisoner has confessed. Meet me
    at the Cliff House at eight o'clock," and bore the signature of
    Locke.</p>

    <p>Thus, with their plans carefully laid, the Automaton and his
    emissaries plotted, and soon a messenger was on his way to Eva
    with the faked message.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, as the day wore on, the treacherous guard
    returned on duty at the prison, and at the first opportunity
    made his way to the cell in which the emissary was locked. In a
    hoarse whisper he told the fellow of the success of his mission
    and of the plan, slipping to him the cap and goggles through
    the bars.</p>

    <p>Locke had been waiting for hours impatiently on his bunk,
    but now was all attention, though he was careful not to betray
    it. As the guard left and the emissary was trying on the cap
    and goggles, Locke came to his cell door. Now was the time to
    act.</p>

    <p>He began working noiselessly and swiftly with the bolts,
    deftly determining just how the tumblers fell until he was able
    to slip the bolt. He peered into the next cell. The emissary
    had retired to his own bunk to await the time of rescue. Locke
    saw his chance, and at once began unlocking the cell door. As
    the emissary heard him, he concluded that it was the guard come
    to release him, and sprang from his bunk just as Locke entered.
    He suspected nothing until a stray ray of light fell on Locke's
    face. But then it was too late either for him to put up much of
    a fight or to make an outcry. For with a swift blow Locke
    disposed of him and carried the fellow, unconscious, into his
    own cell, where he locked the door again, hurrying back to the
    emissary's cell, where he donned the fellow's clothes, of which
    he had stripped him, and appropriated the cap and goggles. Then
    Locke waited for the rescue that was to lead, he was sure,
    straight to the villains he wished to capture.</p>

    <p>At Brent Rock, the faked telegram from Locke had been
    delivered and Eva was overjoyed to learn of his seeming
    success. As it happened, Zita was in the library when the
    butler brought the message in, and, all animation, was eager to
    accompany Eva to the meeting-place. But Eva would not listen to
    it.</p>

    <p>So, not many moments before eight that night, while Locke
    was waiting in the jail for the rescuers, Eva climbed into her
    speedster, eager to keep the appointment which she was
    convinced would clear up the mystery.</p>

    <p>In the darkness outside the jail, by this time, was waiting
    the false turnkey when an open car drove up with its motor
    silenced. He had been expecting it and so was ready when a
    heavily goggled man climbed out and signaled to him. In the
    back of the car was another man, also goggled, while the
    chauffeur, alone, had his face also well hidden by a cap over
    his eyes and his collar pulled up.</p>

    <p>Understanding perfectly, the guard hurried into the jail,
    making sure that the coast was clear, and down the cell row to
    the cell where Locke was waiting impatiently, now dressed and
    hunched up in a perfect imitation of the emissary. The turnkey
    opened the door and whispered to Locke, who nodded gruffly, and
    together they sneaked quietly out.</p>

    <p>With scarcely another word, outside, Locke leaped into the
    waiting car and the four were off, leaving the false turnkey
    chuckling over his cleverness and ready to make a get-away.</p>

    <p>Locke glanced furtively from the driver to the other two
    passengers in the car as it sped along in the direction of the
    cliffs. So far everything had gone fine. When would they begin
    to suspect the substitution he had played on them? He revolved
    rapidly in his mind just what he would do under various
    circumstances.</p>

    <p>"Well, old pal," exclaimed one, clapping him on the
    shoulders, "how does it seem to be out?"</p>

    <p>Locke replied with gruff heartiness, and the others now
    began to remove their goggles. Locke, however, did not do the
    same. They exchanged a glance.</p>

    <p>Already Eva had arrived at the Cliff House, had left her
    car, and was approaching on foot, just as Locke with the now
    thoroughly aroused emissaries swung into sight.</p>

    <p>With a shout to the driver, the two in the back of the car
    leaped at Locke at once, and, as the car stopped, the chauffeur
    joined them.</p>

    <p>Even prepared as he was, Locke was no match for three of
    them, and, fighting furiously, all four combatants rolled over
    and over as they came closer to the door of an old acid-mill
    that adjoined the Cliff House.</p>

    <p>"We must keep him from saving the girl," panted the leader
    of the emissaries to the others.</p>

    <p>Inside the old building stood some huge tanks of acid, and
    as they rolled nearer and nearer to them it became evident that
    Locke was in their power.</p>

    <p>Suddenly one emissary reached out and secured a coil of
    rope, which he unwound quickly. The others, too, saw their
    chance. It was fiendish. Round and round they wound the rope
    until they had Locke well-nigh helpless. Then one of them cast
    the end of the coil over a beam, all seized the end as it fell
    on the other side, and Locke found himself dangling head
    downward from the beam, suspended over the vat of acid.</p>

    <p>They were about to drop him into it when one, more alert and
    more fiendish than the rest, cried out, "Look!"</p>

    <p>Through a window now they could see Eva, and back of her the
    terrible figure of the Automaton, stalking. She had walked
    directly into the trap, but the fight with Locke had delayed
    the emissaries. Wildly now Eva was running over the lawn, full
    in the direction of the acid-room from the Cliff House.</p>

    <p>"Quick!" directed the emissary. "She'll come in that door.
    Fasten the rope on it. Then his own sweetheart will drop him
    into the acid!"</p>

    <p>It was only a matter of seconds, as the screams of Eva came
    closer and closer, for the emissaries to carry the rope and jam
    it into the door through which pretty soon Eva would run to
    take refuge from the pursuing Automaton. Then they slunk back
    through a rear door, with muttered taunts to Locke, who
    struggled in the tangle of rope as he felt the stinging fumes
    of the acid below.</p>

    <p>Outside, Eva, who had realized at last that it was a trap
    and had no thought that Locke might be anywhere about, fled
    toward the acid-room, while the emissaries hid, ready to seize
    her as she opened the door which was to plunge her lover into a
    horrible death in the acid seething below him.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER XII</p>

    <p>Locke's case seemed at last hopeless. The cruel ropes bit
    into his flesh and increased his agony, while the acrid fumes
    from the seething acid were slowly stupefying that keen brain
    of his.</p>

    <p>Backward and forward like a huge pendulum his body swayed,
    and in an agony of suspense he watched the fatal rope. With
    writhing body he swayed far out, and then he saw just one
    chance.</p>

    <p>The emissaries had thrown the rope over a beam which was far
    above Locke, and it seemed an impossibility for him to reach
    it. For one less resourceful or with a physique less perfectly
    developed, even to try would have been useless. But there was
    one chance in a thousand, and he grasped it eagerly.</p>

    <p>Alternately contracting and relaxing his muscles, Locke
    succeeded in swinging himself in an ever-widening arc. Nearer
    he swung&mdash;back&mdash;and again nearer. Could he make it?
    Back again and a terrific effort. He was gaining.</p>

    <p>There came to him the sound of running feet. In his fear and
    agony he could have shrieked, but from his parched throat there
    issued no sound. Friend or foe, for him it meant the same
    fate&mdash;one touch on that knob and a torturing death by
    fire.</p>

    <p>With bursting muscles he redoubled his efforts. In a long
    sweep his body swayed out and up. Would he be in time? Those
    pattering feet, they were coming nearer and nearer. There were
    now but a few yards between them and that knob.</p>

    <p>A mighty swing, a monstrous heave, his fingers crooked
    talon-like, and he touched the rafter, clutched&mdash;and
    missed.</p>

    <p>Downward and backward, his mind now reeling in black
    despair. He had tried and failed. This was the end. The sound
    of footsteps had ceased. Well he knew that some one was at the
    door. He tried to pray and then&mdash;he crashed against the
    rafter. Mechanically he grasped at it and clung.</p>

    <p>The door flew open, and there stood Eva. All the horrors of
    imminent death, even the pain of sorely tried muscles, were
    momentarily forgotten in his relief at seeing her safe and
    having saved himself. But not yet was he free. The emissaries
    had been thorough in their work, but it was not many moments
    before the last knot was loose and he dropped to the floor.</p>

    <p>Locke peered stealthily about. To all appearances everything
    was clear. He placed his arm about Eva and they started to
    steal out. Well they knew that, with such enemies, not for a
    moment would they dare relax their caution. For them every
    angle and nook was a temporary haven. Slowly they drew away
    from the dread spot, and soon came to a more populous locality
    where the lights of honest shops and peaceful homes gave them a
    sense of greater security and brought a feeling of unreality to
    the horrors through which they had passed.</p>

    <p>A taxi-driver hailed them, and in a short time they were
    rolling along the Cliff Drive and had arrived at Brent
    Rock.</p>

    <p>It was the following day that the old butler handed Locke a
    letter addressed to International Patents, Incorporated, from
    the Diving and Salvage Company. Locke was about to read it,
    when Eva entered and they read it together.</p>

    <p>"We are reliably informed," read the letter, "that the Under
    Seas Corporation is trying to obtain possession of the
    self-liberating diving-suit which you control in our interest.
    This must be prevented."</p>

    <p>Locke was immediately interested. At once it occurred to him
    that here was a patent which the company had suppressed which
    might prove of incalculable value.</p>

    <p>"This suit might be very valuable to the government," he
    exclaimed to Eva. "I am going to try it myself."</p>

    <p>"Please don't," pleaded Eva. "It isn't worth it. It's not
    worth the risk."</p>

    <p>Locke, however, realized that here was something of extreme
    importance, and as he visualized to Eva the helplessness of a
    deep-sea diver, his air-line cut, struggling in vain to release
    himself and rise to the surface, he began to win her over.</p>

    <p>At the moment when Quentin and Eva were in the library, Zita
    was taking advantage and was ransacking Locke's laboratory, not
    with any definite purpose in mind, but searching in every nook
    for some clue which might tell her what he was about.</p>

    <p>The speed with which she worked was extraordinary. Yet,
    before she moved an instrument, a retort, a book, its position
    was minutely studied, so that she could restore it to its
    former place without any one suspecting that it had ever been
    moved.</p>

    <p>It was while she was thus occupied that her eye fell upon an
    instrument which aroused in her an excited interest. It was
    very like the headpiece used by operators of telephones, and
    she hastened to adjust it. In a moment it was as though she
    were in the library. She could hear Locke's earnest laugh and
    in it Zita could detect an undercurrent of tenderness. Her lips
    compressed and her eyes hardened as she listened. Locke was
    speaking about a letter and it seemed to be something
    important. Zita was all ears.</p>

    <p>But Locke's next words which she heard were his decision to
    test the diving-suit, and as she listened she became tense, for
    this information she knew was important. The continued note of
    tenderness in Locke's voice more infuriated Zita. She removed
    the headpiece of the dictagraph, slammed it back into the desk
    drawer from which she had taken it, and hurried out.</p>

    <p>In the library, Locke, having persuaded Eva, left her and
    went down into the Graveyard of Genius, where he touched the
    secret spring and the massive door flew open. He entered the
    gloomy place and went at once to the shelf upon which lay the
    self-liberating diving-suit. He took the suit down and examined
    its every detail minutely. As he did so he became more and more
    enthusiastic and he could find no fault with any of its
    features.</p>

    <p>"It's entirely practical," he exclaimed to himself. "I'm
    going to try it to-day."</p>

    <p>He closed the great door and remounted the stairs, carrying
    the suit with him. But had he noticed the fiery eyes that had
    watched him through the secret rock door of the cavern he would
    not have been so eager to try the test he had in mind.</p>

    <p>By this time Eva had called her car, and together Locke and
    Eva drove to the near-by cove, where there was a little launch
    which he planned to use.</p>

    <p>Out into the river they sailed, Eva at the wheel, while
    Locke busied himself over the sputtering engine. Soon they
    arrived at a spot which was suitable for the test of the
    suit.</p>

    <p>Locke had brought along the full equipment, and, while Eva
    took charge of the air-pump, Locke donned the diving-suit. Soon
    all was ready and Locke descended over the side, after
    carefully instructing Eva in each detail. Eva started pumping,
    while with her other hand she carefully paid out the air-line
    and signal-cord.</p>

    <p>But in their close attention to the task in hand, neither
    had noticed a low, knifelike launch that had followed them and
    that was now hovering a short distance off.</p>

    <p>Locke was now walking over the shell-strewn bottom,
    examining curious objects here and there. The tide was setting
    in strongly and at times it was with difficulty that he kept
    his feet.</p>

    <p>He had become satisfied that this particular suit filled all
    the requirements of a first-class diving-suit, and he was about
    to try its special, self-liberating feature, when his attention
    was arrested by a vague mass which seemingly moved against the
    current.</p>

    <p>This was so extraordinary that his first thought was of a
    shark. He stopped in his tracks and became motionless, for it
    is a well-known fact that these sea tigers rarely see an object
    unless it is in motion. Still, the vague form slowly took on
    more distinctness as in its course it gradually drew nearer to
    him. It was then that Locke was almost overcome with surprise.
    For there, groping his way toward him, was a diver, like
    himself.</p>

    <p>What was this strange being doing there on the bottom of the
    sea? Whence had he come? Locke could not guess. For, like Eva,
    he had not noticed the other launch. It seemed impossible to
    him. Still, to him, apart from curiosity at the appearance of
    the other diver, the incident had no other interest. What had
    he to fear from any man at the bottom of a peaceful harbor?
    Locke moved nearer.</p>

    <p>The stranger allowed him to approach, stopped, even, as
    though he were himself amazed at Locke's appearance, and Locke
    made gestures to reassure the man of his good intentions.</p>

    <p>Locke was quite close now, and through the glass gate in the
    other's helmet he could see his eyes. But in those eyes he
    could see no responding friendliness. There was a murderous
    hate instead. He tried to step back and place himself in a
    position for defense, but he was too late. For, with a movement
    amazingly rapid for one under water, the stranger leaped upon
    him, at the same time drawing a long knife. There, under the
    sea, commenced a battle royal.</p>

    <p>Locke was unarmed and so from the start was at a
    disadvantage. The stranger seemed not so anxious to stab him as
    to come to close quarters, and before Locke could prevent him
    he had done so. With his left hand he grabbed Locke's lines,
    while with the other, in which was the keen knife, he slashed
    murderously.</p>

    <p>Locke tried to break his grip. But the other was not to be
    denied. With one stroke he cut through both lines, pushing
    Locke backward and himself springing free at the same time.</p>

    <p>Immediately Locke's helmet filled with sea water, while the
    pressure became enormous. Locke tried to hold his breath, while
    his hand searched for the liberating knob. He gave it one
    twist. It worked perfectly. Locke's suit, including the helmet,
    simply opened and fell from him.</p>

    <p>Propelled as much by the pressure that the water exerted as
    by his own powerful strokes, Locke shot to the surface.</p>

    <p>The day was perfect and the bay was calm. For a few seconds
    Locke floated, drawing the air into his starving lungs. Then he
    raised himself and gazed about him. At first glance everything
    seemed the same except for the fact that, whereas before his
    own boat had been alone, there were now two. Then Locke heard
    an agonizing call for help&mdash;from Eva.</p>

    <p>After he had gone over the side of their launch Eva was
    naturally very intent upon keeping him plentifully supplied
    with air. He had been down some time before, glancing about,
    she had spied the other launch. But at the time she had thought
    little of it. For her, all thought of danger was centered on
    the man who was now risking his life many fathoms beneath her
    from pure motives of patriotism.</p>

    <p>It was only, some minutes later, when she heard the grating
    of another boat against the side of her own that she realized
    that she herself stood in danger. But even at that moment her
    thoughts were of Quentin, who now for the first time was wholly
    dependent on her efforts alone. She looked up fearfully, and
    what she saw fairly congealed the blood in her veins. Directing
    a murderous emissary to board Eva's launch, in the cockpit of
    the other boat stood the Automaton!</p>

    <p>Not for an instant did Eva cease her efforts at the pump.
    But she shrieked with terror again and again. Now, to add to
    that terror, the pressure on the air-pump suddenly ceased. From
    the depths myriads of bubbles of air arose.</p>

    <p>Knife in hand, the emissary leaped aboard and came toward
    her. Automatically, frantically, she still turned the useless
    pump, while with her free arm she tried to ward off the poised
    knife.</p>

    <p>Again her shriek for help echoed across the water&mdash;and
    this time her call was answered.</p>

    <p>Had she gone mad? The voice that answered her was the voice
    of the man she loved. Her brain reeled and she fell at the feet
    of the murderous thug.</p>

    <p>Other cries, then shouts were now heard, for some fisher
    folk were putting out off shore to discover what all the tumult
    was about.</p>

    <p>The Automaton made a hasty gesture to the emissary, who
    sprang back from his victim and leaped to his own launch,
    where, with his assistance, there was barely time to haul
    aboard the chief thug, who had been sent below to attack Locke.
    The launch cast off and with ever-increasing speed headed down
    the river.</p>

    <p>Locke was the first to arrive and climb over the side of the
    boat. Dripping though he was, he took Eva in his arms and
    bathed her face, while by this time other craft arrived and
    friendly hands did all they could to care for them both.</p>

    <p>It was some minutes before Eva was restored and all headed
    again to the shore, eager to help Locke.</p>

    <p>As he assisted Eva to land, and they waited for a carriage,
    Locke hastily offered a boatman a liberal reward for the
    discovery of the precious diving-suit, for it had been his
    intention to present the patent to the government.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile some strange things had happened. Paul and his
    father had quarreled over money, over De Luxe Dora, over Paul's
    manner of life and his ill luck in winning Eva's
    affections.</p>

    <p>At the same time Dora had become more insistent in her
    demands for money to meet her extravagances, and Paul conceived
    an idea of selling one of the patents to a rival company.
    Strange to say, it had been the self-liberating diving-suit and
    the rival company was the Under Seas Company.</p>

    <p>All this took place some time after the disappearance of the
    Automaton and his precious crew.</p>

    <p>Some hours later that evening a telephone message came for
    Locke from the boatman that the diving-suit had been recovered
    and was being held by him.</p>

    <p>Locke replied that he would be down in an hour. But during
    that hour other strange things occurred. For no sooner had the
    boatman hung up his receiver than a pleasant voice hailed him
    and he left his house to investigate. It was Paul Balcom.</p>

    <p>It was in a clever, insinuating, affable manner that Paul
    approached the real object of his visit. His appeal was
    cleverly worded, cleverly presented. The sole object was to
    awaken the poor boatman's cupidity.</p>

    <p>The sum mentioned, no less a sum than five thousand dollars,
    would mean luxury to the poor man. And all for what? Simply to
    call up a stranger, a Mr. Locke, to tell him that the boatman
    demanded more money since he had telephoned before, that the
    cash was to be placed by him in an old packing-case from which
    a stationary engine had been removed that morning. It was just
    an exchange. That was all.</p>

    <p>"Sure I'll do that," the boatman told Paul, and Paul,
    smiling craftily, gave him his hand to seal the bargain.</p>

    <p>The boatman went back to his quarters and again called Brent
    Rock, making his new demands. Locke was tremendously indignant,
    but he wanted the suit quickly to prevent its falling into
    unscrupulous hands. He agreed and immediately started for the
    dock.</p>

    <p>The boatman turned from his telephone and, picking up the
    suit, regarded it curiously. "Five thousand dollars," he
    muttered. "Five thousand dollars." And he shook his head
    wonderingly.</p>

    <p>He was standing near an open window and was commencing to
    fold the suit preparatory to taking it to the end of the dock
    where lay the engine-case, when, without the slightest warning,
    three emissaries of the Automaton, who had appeared just a
    moment before on the dock, leaped through the window and felled
    him to the floor. He struggled feebly, but it was no use, and a
    final blow left him unconscious.</p>

    <p>The emissaries next grabbed the diving-suit and left
    hurriedly by the way they had come. But they had not completed
    what it was they sought to do.</p>

    <p>The old boatman was not as badly hurt as it seemed and was
    able to drag himself across the floor with just strength enough
    to pull the telephone from the table and call Brent Rock. Then
    as weakness again overcame him he managed to blurt out a
    message to Eva, who answered.</p>

    <p>"Don't let Mr. Locke come to the dock," he managed to gasp.
    "He'll be killed." Then he collapsed and fainted.</p>

    <p>Eva tried frantically to get the boatman again on the wire,
    but it was useless. Quickly a plan formed in her mind.</p>

    <p>If she could only intercept Locke before he reached the
    dock!</p>

    <p>She dashed out to the garage, realizing that it was almost
    hopeless, since Locke had been gone some time. Hoping against
    hope, she jumped into her speedster and swung out and down the
    road.</p>

    <p>The fact was that even as she sped along toward the cove
    Locke was passing the arched gate of the dock.</p>

    <p>He called at the boatman's little shack. Of course there was
    no reply. To all appearances it was deserted. Thinking to find
    him at the very end of the dock where he had been told to place
    the money, he proceeded to the engine-case.</p>

    <p>He was slightly surprised at not finding the boatman there,
    but as that was no part of the agreement it engaged his
    attention for only a moment. He started to withdraw the money
    from his pocket, groping at the same time to see if the
    diving-suit was actually in the case.</p>

    <p>He was bending over when suddenly there was a rush of men
    behind him and a blackjack in the hands of one of the ruffians
    just missed his head.</p>

    <p>He fought, but their numbers were overwhelming. Like a pack
    of wolves they pulled him down.</p>

    <p>Locke was quickly bound with ropes and forced into the
    engine-case. The cover was put on and they nailed it down
    solidly. To make it doubly sure this time the case was then
    lashed with ropes and they were knotted.</p>

    <p>Next the emissaries carried the case to a sloping landing
    stage, preparatory to casting it into the river.</p>

    <p>It was at this moment that Eva came running down the dock in
    wild search to intercept Locke. Wide-eyed, in the moonlight,
    she paused at what she saw.</p>

    <p>The emissaries had given the packing-case its final shove.
    Scraping, it slid down the incline and toppled overboard. There
    was a great splash as it struck the water and immediately began
    to sink in the depths.</p>

    <p>The engine exhaust had evidently protruded from the case, as
    there was a hole in its side slightly larger than a man's hand.
    To Eva's horror, though she had half expected it, she saw
    actually a hand thrust forth from this hole as if waving
    frantically.</p>

    <p>The box sank lower as it rapidly filled with water.</p>

    <p>Eva knew not what to do. Instinctively she knew that it was
    Locke. It was as though he had waved a last farewell.</p>

    <p>Only the hand now showed above the surface. Finally that,
    too, disappeared beneath the waves.</p>

    <p>Despairingly she turned to see if there was anything on the
    dock with which she might help Locke&mdash;and she saw the
    Automaton himself advancing from the shore toward her. She
    turned. The emissaries on the other end of the dock cut off any
    chance in that direction.</p>

    <p>Without a moment's hesitation Eva poised herself a moment on
    the edge of the dock and leaped far out into the blackness of
    the river.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

    <p>The box that held Locke a prisoner was now undoubtedly
    resting on the slimy bottom. Eva had totally disappeared. The
    Automaton, convinced that at last he had rid himself of his
    victims, waved away the emissaries and departed.</p>

    <p>Except for the tiny lights of ships on the river and the
    staccato exhaust of a tugboat, the river flowed with nothing to
    remind one of the two tragedies of only a few seconds ago.</p>

    <p>As far as the eye could see, the surface of the water was
    unbroken. Then, suddenly, the scene changed. For from out the
    water, as though hurled up by a catapult, shot a man's
    body.</p>

    <p>It was Locke.</p>

    <p>By what miracle had he escaped from the watery grave?</p>

    <p>From the time he was a small boy the study of locks and
    bolts, of knots and strait-jackets, of anything that could
    restrain or bind a man, had held a marvelous fascination for
    him, until now he was recognized as one of the world's greatest
    experts on these subjects. The great lock concerns often sent
    for him to test new inventions, and invariably he could point
    to any flaw in the constructions of them that existed. As he
    came to manhood his knowledge had grown apace until to many he
    seemed a veritable sorcerer.</p>

    <p>It was by a trick known only to himself that he had been
    able to extricate himself from his desperate plight at the
    river's bottom. True, his flesh was lacerated. True, he was on
    the verge of total collapse. But he lived.</p>

    <p>He made his way slowly toward the dock and was resting
    against one of the piles when he heard a faint cry. He strained
    his ears to locate the direction whence it came. Once again
    that feeble call floated across the water, and in it there
    sounded something vaguely familiar.</p>

    <p>He was more rested now and he swam farther under the dock.
    Again came the cry. With a thrill now he recognized the
    voice.</p>

    <p>"Eva!" he called, again and again.</p>

    <p>"Here I am," came back the echo.</p>

    <p>With a powerful stroke he breasted the current and in a
    moment he was supporting her half-fainting body. Precarious
    though their position was, Locke felt the thrill of her words.
    The effect was to spur him on to fresh efforts.</p>

    <p>Eva had become stronger now. For a few moments he swam, in
    order, if possible, to find some means by which they might
    escape from the water and reach the dock.</p>

    <p>They had no way of knowing but that the Automaton and his
    emissaries might still be lurking above, ready to thrust them
    back into the water or to reserve for them some even more
    terrible fate. But it was a risk that they realized must be
    taken and at once. An attempt to swim to another dock could end
    only disastrously.</p>

    <p>Locke soon returned with the cheering news that he had
    discovered a ladder that came even to the surface of the water,
    a landing for small boats. More than that, he had mounted the
    ladder, and from a short survey he had seen no sign of their
    enemies.</p>

    <p>Carefully aiding Eva, Locke swam to this ladder and soon
    they stood upon the dock, safe.</p>

    <p>With great caution they moved toward the street and, without
    harm, finally passed beneath the arched gates again and were in
    the city street.</p>

    <p>Eva went at once to her father's room. His condition was one
    of great weakness. The laughing madness had abated in so far
    that the poor victim was so weak that the spasms could not
    maintain a very violent form.</p>

    <p>Eva practised all those little kindnesses which are known
    only to women, and tears were in her eyes as she stroked his
    poor gray head.</p>

    <p>How terrible was it that, after all they had attempted, all
    that they had suffered, they should still stand defeated in
    their aim to get the antidote that would cure her father's
    malady. However, the brave girl was not one to admit herself
    beaten, and even as she sat there she was planning new ways to
    discover who were her terrible adversaries and to bring defeat
    to them.</p>

    <p>At Brent Rock the next morning an aged inventor named
    Winters arrived before Locke was down-stairs, and was shown
    into the library to wait.</p>

    <p>Locke soon descended from the laboratory and went into the
    room to meet him. But Winters was so agitated that at first he
    could hardly speak. It was some moments before he gained
    control.</p>

    <p>"What can I do for you, sir?" inquired Locke, although he
    knew the man must be one wronged by the patents company.</p>

    <p>"One of my inventions was returned to me, when I protested
    once," the man replied, "but nothing has been done about two
    others."</p>

    <p>"Please try to have a little further patience," pleaded
    Locke. "Everything is being done to assure justice to all."</p>

    <p>"But, Mr. Locke," the man persisted, "I must insist on the
    return or the immediate marketing of the two inventions now in
    the possession of International Patents or I will&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He paused, for Eva had entered and was overhearing what
    Winters was demanding.</p>

    <p>"I am sure that, as my father returned one of your
    inventions," she interrupted, "he would wish me to return the
    other two, and I shall do so at once. Mr. Locke, will you be so
    kind as to get them?"</p>

    <p>Locke immediately left the room and descended to the
    Graveyard of Genius for the two models.</p>

    <p>In the laboratory above were Balcom and Zita, for she had
    told him of her discovery of the dictagraph. Balcom had the
    headpiece firmly clamped over his head and was drinking in the
    purport of the conversation down in the library.</p>

    <p>Zita was almost beside herself with curiosity, as Balcom
    repeated only scraps of the conversation that went on below,
    but finally the real subject of the whole matter was repeated
    to her and she was satisfied at last. A peculiar look came into
    her eyes. As for Balcom, one would have thought that a whole
    world's treasure had suddenly been placed within his grasp. Yet
    each was cautious not to betray too much to the other.</p>

    <p>Over the dictagraph came the words spoken by Eva, "Mr. Locke
    and I will come to your workshop at eight this evening to
    complete the transaction."</p>

    <p>Locke in the mean time had brought the two models into the
    library and the inventor had almost danced with joy at seeing
    the children of his brain again.</p>

    <p>Sent down by Balcom, Zita had been ordered to spy on Eva and
    Locke. She had been nearly caught by Locke as he was returning
    from the Graveyard of Genius, but had slipped behind a pair of
    portières at the end of the hall and had emerged only when
    Locke had entered the library. She had crept close to the door
    and was listening.</p>

    <p>She, too, now heard the inventor exact a promise from Eva
    and Locke not to fail to be at his workshop at eight that
    night.</p>

    <p>Zita had but a second to glide backward from the door as the
    inventor came out into the hallway where she stood. He gazed at
    her in such a strange, fixed manner that an uncanny feeling
    came over her. Then he passed out, just as Balcom came down the
    stairs.</p>

    <p>"Why did that man look at me in such a strange manner?" she
    queried of Balcom.</p>

    <p>A moment Balcom considered her, as though undecided to
    speak, then made up his mind.</p>

    <p>"Because," he replied, slowly, "he knows the secret of your
    birth, knows who you really are."</p>

    <p>Zita had no further chance to question Balcom, for at this
    instant Eva and Locke, still carrying the inventions, were
    leaving the library. Locke turned down again toward the
    stairway leading to the Graveyard of Genius, while Eva, nodding
    pleasantly to Zita and Balcom, mounted the stairs leading to
    her father's room.</p>

    <p>Zita turned questioningly again to Balcom.</p>

    <p>"Half of everything that girl possesses rightfully belongs
    to you," he whispered.</p>

    <p>Zita apparently did not understand. "What shall I do to
    obtain my rights?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Do as I say," returned Balcom, as he left quickly.</p>

    <p>It was some hours later that in the dark corner of the
    Graveyard of Genius the huge rock slowly swung outward. There
    was a clanging and clanking of metal. Two fiery eyes gleamed
    through the aperture and out stalked the hideous monster, the
    Automaton. With strange ominousness it went directly to the two
    models which Locke had returned, took them, turned and went
    back through the great gap in the wall from which it had come.
    Again slowly the huge rock swung back into place.</p>

    <p>Locke, with some sort of intuition, had deduced that young
    Paul Balcom by his very absence might have played a leading
    part in all the events in which both Eva and himself had been
    thwarted and almost killed. Accordingly he determined to find
    and trail Paul.</p>

    <p>It was some time after the models had been stolen in his
    absence that, in a taxicab, Locke, having gone from place to
    place which he knew Paul frequented, at last caught sight of
    him leaving a dance-hall of very ill repute. Paul was just
    stepping into a car which whisked him off rapidly and Locke
    gave an order to his own driver to follow him.</p>

    <p>They wove in and out of various streets and finally turned
    up the Drive, where, after a few minutes, Paul's car came to a
    stop before a palatial apartment-house and Paul alighted.
    Looking up and down the Drive and seeing nothing to cause him
    suspicion, Paul entered the house.</p>

    <p>Locke carefully noted the address, then leaned back in his
    cab to await developments.</p>

    <p>Paul was taken to the third floor and there was admitted to
    a gorgeous apartment.</p>

    <p>"I thought you'd never get here," languidly greeted the
    feline De Luxe Dora.</p>

    <p>She led him to a chaise-longue seductively, taking care,
    however, that he should see a pile of unpaid bills that lay
    upon a table near it.</p>

    <p>Paul was not entirely at his ease and wasted no time in
    coming to the point.</p>

    <p>"Look here, Dora," he began; "I know you can't run this
    shack on air. I got your note this morning. I've been busy and
    I've got an idea. I've made up my mind to take a couple of
    those inventions the company owns and sell them. It means
    coin."</p>

    <p>Dora's eyes gleamed avariciously.</p>

    <p>"Be patient," Paul added, "and I'll have you swimming in
    gold."</p>

    <p>At this juncture three young fellows of the cabaret type,
    better known as "lounge lizards," were admitted to the
    apartment.</p>

    <p>Paul cast a glance at Dora which clearly spelled jealousy
    and reproach. He knew the fellows. In fact, there were few
    denizens of the underworld whom he did not know. Concealing his
    vexation, he tried to greet them easily.</p>

    <p>The fellows returned the salutation hastily.</p>

    <p>"Say, Balcom," hastened one of them, "some one is on your
    trail, shadowing you."</p>

    <p>Paul was startled and furious, but in this emergency it was
    Dora who thought out the plan of action.</p>

    <p>"In a taxicab?" she repeated, as the others told what they
    had seen outside. "Listen to me, Paul. Go to the window and
    show yourself. Then leave the house. This fellow Locke will
    investigate&mdash;and we'll tend to the rest."</p>

    <p>Paul moved to the window, opened it, and stepped out on a
    small balcony. Dora slipped to his side and for a moment they
    stood there gazing apparently at the view of the river. Then
    they re-entered the apartment.</p>

    <p>"Now go, Paul," said Dora. "Whoever this fellow is, we'll
    handle him."</p>

    <p>Paul started to get his hat, then stopped and from his
    pocket drew out a small package.</p>

    <p>"I was going to use this elsewhere," he said, "but it might
    come in handy to&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Dora reached for the package, but Paul withdrew it
    hastily.</p>

    <p>"Careful, Dora," he admonished. "There's a small gas-bomb
    inside."</p>

    <p>The five now conferred a bit and it was agreed that this
    time the inquisitive Mr. Locke would surely trouble them no
    more.</p>

    <p>"With Locke out of the way," promised Paul to Dora, "the
    road to our fortune is clear."</p>

    <p>A moment later Paul left the apartment, descended in the
    elevator, and jumped into a taxicab and was off.</p>

    <p>Locke from his cab had, of course, seen all this, had seen
    Paul and Dora on the balcony and the departure. But he knew
    nothing of the three men who had gone to the same
    apartment.</p>

    <p>He waited until Paul passed out of sight, then stepped out
    of his cab, making a careful calculation as to the exact
    location of the woman's apartment, for he had determined to
    find out about her. From the hall boy he learned that it was De
    Luxe Dora, of whom he knew, and it was only a matter of seconds
    when he was admitted.</p>

    <p>Dora swept over graciously toward him.</p>

    <p>"Will you answer me one question?" he asked, in answer to a
    query from her.</p>

    <p>She nodded assent.</p>

    <p>"How long have you known Mr. Balcom's son?"</p>

    <p>"He is an old friend," she replied. "I'm expecting him to
    return at any moment. Won't you be seated? Please excuse me
    just a moment."</p>

    <p>Before Locke could say a word she had left the room. Left
    alone himself, Locke took in all the details of the room and
    again and again his eye wandered to a Louis XIV desk.</p>

    <p>Feeling certain that this woman was without doubt connected
    in some way with the plots, he felt justified in opening the
    desk to obtain evidence. He tiptoed over to it and tried to
    open it. It stuck at first, but after one or two silent,
    well-directed blows which he so well knew how to administer the
    sliding panel stood unlocked.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:400px;">
        <a href="images/310.jpg"
             name="image310"
             id="image310"><img width="400"
             src="images/310s.jpg"
             alt="LOCKE COMES UPON STARTLING EVIDENCE" /></a>
        locke comes upon startling evidence
    </div>

    <p>He glanced around. There was no one to be seen. He moved
    back the panel. There was a flash and a tiny puff of smoke.
    Locke coughed once, clutched at his throat, and lay gasping on
    the floor.</p>

    <p>Immediately the three men rushed out, carrying ropes and
    holding handkerchiefs to their nostrils. One ran to the window
    and threw it wide open, admitting gusts of air to clear away
    the fumes. The others began to bind Locke as De Luxe Dora
    appeared in the doorway and calmly directed operations.</p>

    <p>On the roof of the apartment several moments later in the
    just-gathering dusk five figures might have been seen. Three
    men and a woman were conferring, while at their feet was a man
    tightly bound and unconscious.</p>

    <p>In the background was a huge water-tank, with a ladder
    leading to its brim.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the conspirators straightened up. They had come to
    a decision. The three men lifted the unconscious figure and
    bore it up the ladder. The tank was empty. One of the men
    jumped down into it, while the others lowered their victim
    after him. Then they passed down ropes.</p>

    <p>There were two spouts at the bottom of the tank through
    which water was pumped. Also there were pipes running upward.
    To these pipes they tied Locke. Then the men climbed out and,
    as their last fiendish act, turned the water on.</p>

    <p>With a sneer Dora turned and led the way down-stairs
    again.</p>

    <p>"They'll find his body when they have to clean the tank
    again," she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>At Brent Rock, during the absence of Locke, Eva had donned
    her street clothes, since it was nearing the hour of eight when
    she and Locke were due to be at the inventor's workshop to
    render the restitution. She went down-stairs and asked the
    butler about Locke. But the man replied that Mr. Locke had not
    yet returned.</p>

    <p>Eva was very uneasy by this time, and, thinking to save
    time, was about to go down to the Graveyard of Genius to get
    the models of the two inventions, when Zita came down the hall
    carrying a fair sized package which she tried hard to conceal.
    Eva greeted her and continued down to the cellar, as Zita, with
    a sort of grim smile, left the house.</p>

    <p>Eva came to the great door, pushed the secret spring, and in
    a moment was inside the gloomy place. She went directly to the
    spot where the two inventions had been kept. They were
    gone.</p>

    <p>Alarmed, she rushed up-stairs.</p>

    <p>Still Locke did not return. Nor did any word come from him.
    It was now very near to eight. Eva decided to go, for surely
    Locke would be there.</p>

    <p>When Zita arrived at the inventor's, in her hands was still
    the mysterious package. She carried it gingerly, then raised it
    to her ear. From within it there came a faint ticking sound.
    What was it inside?</p>

    <p>She looked at her wrist-watch. It was still some minutes
    before eight. She knocked at the inventor's door.</p>

    <p>The inventor at once admitted her. It was a neat little
    workshop in which every detail had been thought out with
    care&mdash;the home, one might say, of a methodical
    workman.</p>

    <p>The inventor manifested some surprise at seeing Zita, but
    politely asked her to enter, and offered her a chair. Zita
    declined and plainly showed her nervousness.</p>

    <p>"Will you please give this package to Mr. Locke and Miss
    Brent when they come at eight?" she asked.</p>

    <p>Winters agreed and accepted the package, looking quizzically
    at her as he did so, just as he had earlier in the day.</p>

    <p>Zita, unable to control her curiosity, burst out with the
    question uppermost on her mind.</p>

    <p>"Why do you look at me in such a strange manner?" she
    queried.</p>

    <p>The inventor merely turned his gaze away and shrugged.</p>

    <p>"Mr Balcom tells me that you know the secret of my birth,"
    pressed Zita.</p>

    <p>The inventor looked up quickly. "Who did Mr. Balcom say you
    were?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"He told me that I was Brent's daughter," replied Zita,
    keenly watching the aged face.</p>

    <p>"Balcom lied to you," hastened the inventor.</p>

    <p>Already there was a ponderous tread on the stairs, but
    Winters did not seem to notice it.</p>

    <p>"You are not Brent's daughter," he pursued, more slowly.</p>

    <p>The door opened swiftly and an emissary stood framed there,
    a knife poised in his hand. Behind him stood the Automaton.</p>

    <p>"You are&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At that instant the inventor caught sight of the intruders.
    With a look of horror in his eyes he threw out his hands to
    protect himself, but he was too late. The knife whizzed through
    the air and a second later pierced his throat. He fell to the
    floor&mdash;dead.</p>

    <p>At the moment when the emissary, followed by the Automaton,
    entered, Zita, watching her chance, managed to escape from the
    room, stumbled, and almost half-fell down the stairs.</p>

    <p>Already, in the huge water-tank that stood on the roof of
    the apartment of Dora, Locke had revived as he felt the water
    and had found himself already half submerged, with the water
    rapidly pouring in. At first he could not grasp his terrible
    predicament, but before long the full horror of it burst on him
    and he struggled madly to free himself. Since his body was
    stretched at full length, it was impossible to use the ordinary
    tricks of which he was master. His arms were bound, and he well
    knew that to release one of them constituted his sole chance of
    escape.</p>

    <p>He contracted his muscles and, inch by inch, he worked his
    right arm free. By this time the water had risen until he was
    fairly beneath its surface. Could he last long enough to free
    himself?</p>

    <p>He worked frantically. Finally, with his lungs almost
    bursting, he managed to free the other arm, then the rope that
    bound his neck. To release his feet was, to him, child's play,
    and he stood up.</p>

    <p>But the water had risen almost to the top of the tank before
    he was able to grasp its brim and draw himself out.</p>

    <p>Once on the roof, there was only one thought in his mind. It
    was nearing eight o'clock, and if Eva kept the appointment at
    the inventor's he knew his adversaries well enough to be sure
    that they would take advantage of his absence.</p>

    <p>He dashed down the stairs and out of the building. Dora and
    her evil band could wait. He must reach the inventor's shop. As
    the seconds sped, so increased his premonition that all would
    not be well there.</p>

    <p>It was at the moment that Zita came flying down-stairs that
    Locke burst into the hallway to the inventor's.</p>

    <p>Zita saw him. Above, she knew was the terrible Automaton and
    his bloodthirsty emissary. More horrible yet, she had her fears
    of the package that had been given her by Balcom to
    deliver.</p>

    <p>"You must not go up there!" she cried, impulsively, flinging
    her arms about Locke's neck.</p>

    <p>Locke tried to remove her arms as he questioned her. But
    Zita either would not or could not tell more. Instead she
    merely clung to him.</p>

    <p>Thus it was that Eva, determined at keeping her appointment
    with the inventor at all costs, entered the hallway at just
    this unpropitious moment. To her it looked as if Locke and Zita
    were very familiar. Could it be that Quentin was such a cad?
    She could not deny the evidence of her eyes.</p>

    <p>Indignantly she brushed past them and rushed up the stairs.
    Locke called after her, but she refused to heed him. He flung
    off the arms of Zita and dashed after her. But Eva was too
    quick for him. She opened the door to the inventor's and went
    in, slamming it behind her. The lock snapped. In an instant Eva
    saw what she had fled into. There was the Automaton, near him
    the emissary with the knife&mdash;and on the floor their victim
    in a pool of blood. She shrieked and tried to escape. But the
    lock had snapped. Besides, the emissary, now directed by the
    monster, blocked her retreat.</p>

    <p>Outside, Locke pounded on the door, but could not open it.
    It was of stout oak and would take some moments to break
    down.</p>

    <p>The emissary circled in one direction. Eva turned, and there
    was the Automaton advancing on her from the other side of the
    room.</p>

    <p>On the table the clock-work bomb, delivered by Zita, whether
    with full knowledge or not, ticked out the last few seconds
    before its timing at precisely eight!</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

    <p>Eva flattened herself against the door at her back. She
    could feel and hear Locke pounding on the other side. She
    thought that she would die of sheer terror.</p>

    <p>The Automaton raised his mighty fist, and Eva instinctively
    ducked under the monster's arm. There was an inner room. Could
    she reach it in time? Would the door be unlocked? At most she
    could only try.</p>

    <p>The emissary tried to catch her, but she proved too quick
    for him. She reached the door. It opened, and she flew into the
    room, slamming and bolting it behind her.</p>

    <p>Now she could hear the thunderous blows of the Automaton
    raining against the door. One huge fist of the monster crashed
    through the panel. Eva crouched down in a far corner and closed
    her eyes. At that instant the time bomb exploded and the house
    was rocked to its foundations.</p>

    <p>Everything was demolished. One entire side of the house was
    blown out. The door leading to the workshop which a moment
    before Locke had been vainly striving to open crashed full upon
    him and felled him, half-stunned, to the floor.</p>

    <p>The force of the explosion had dazed Eva. As for the
    Automaton and the emissary, they had both been blown through a
    gaping aperture in the wall to land in the garden beneath. Only
    Zita, in the lower hallway, was totally untouched by the
    catastrophe.</p>

    <p>Locke, dazed, crawled from under the door and made his way
    into the demolished room in search of Eva, a cold fear gripping
    his heart. How could any living thing have lived after such an
    occurrence? But in another instant he saw her, as she half
    swooned and staggered into the room.</p>

    <p>"Quentin!" she gasped.</p>

    <p>He caught her in his arms. But the next moment she
    remembered what she had witnessed in the hallway below and she
    drew herself away from him.</p>

    <p>"Go to the girl you really love," she scorned.</p>

    <p>"The girl&mdash;I really love?" repeated Locke; then there
    ran through his mind what had happened, as though it had been
    ages ago.</p>

    <p>He protested and tried to explain. But protestations and
    explanations only made matters worse, as usual. Had she not
    with her own eyes seen Locke in Zita's arms?</p>

    <p>"Eva," he persisted, manlike, "I swear that she was only
    trying to save my life. I cannot help it if she&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Locke saw that his defense was only making an innocent
    matter worse, and checked himself. His mind recalled that some
    one had once said that a jealous woman believes a man guilty
    until he proves himself innocent; when he has proved himself
    innocent she merely still suspects. Eva's manner was very
    constrained.</p>

    <p>At that moment a policeman, followed by Zita, entered, and
    Zita, running up to Locke, cried, anxiously, "You're not
    hurt&mdash;are you?"</p>

    <p>Locke answered in an annoyed negative.</p>

    <p>The policeman now questioned them very closely and examined
    the dead inventor's body. Then he entered their names and
    addresses in his note-book.</p>

    <p>Next the officer lead the entire group down to the garden.
    There the horribly injured emissary was trying miserably to
    crawl away.</p>

    <p>The Automaton had totally disappeared.</p>

    <p>Eva immediately ordered that the injured man be taken to
    Brent Rock in her car. Then she turned sharply to Zita.</p>

    <p>"How did you come to be here?" she demanded.</p>

    <p>Zita was startled and confused. It lasted only a minute.
    Then, her mind made up, she replied, defiantly:</p>

    <p>"I came here to discover the secret of my birth. I have been
    told that I am Mr. Brent's daughter."</p>

    <p>Eva was stricken dumb with astonishment at this startling
    claim, but Locke laughed outright.</p>

    <p>"What nonsense!" he scoffed. "Eva, don't listen to it."</p>

    <p>Zita glared at him and with a haughty nod to Eva swept out
    of the garden.</p>

    <p>Eva was still frightfully indignant with Locke and insisted
    on going home alone. However, they arrived at Brent Rock at
    about the same time.</p>

    <p>The emissary had been placed on a lounge in the library and
    a doctor was called. The case was quite hopeless and they
    merely hoped to obtain a confession before he passed away.</p>

    <p>When Eva arrived she went directly to her father's room,
    but, as he was receiving every attention from a trained nurse
    and she could do nothing further to aid him, she returned to
    the library.</p>

    <p>Locke, too, after changing his clothes, still wet from the
    water-tank on the top of the apartment, also went to the
    library.</p>

    <p>At his entrance the doctor glanced at him in a manner to
    indicate that there was no hope of saving the man's life. Locke
    went over to examine him. He was struck by the sly rascality of
    the professional criminal, but he thought little of it at the
    time. He tried to question the emissary, but, except for a
    labored breathing, could extract no response.</p>

    <p>There were voices in the hallway. For a moment the dying man
    showed some signs of returning consciousness. A crafty look
    came over his face. What was he contemplating?</p>

    <p>The door opened and Balcom and his son Paul entered. Balcom
    walked jauntily, but with a suavity of manner that was always
    his. Paul looked at his best, except for the fact that he
    carried his left arm in a silken sling.</p>

    <p>Balcom greeted them all, and at his voice the dying man
    actually showed a sort of agitation. A strong shudder seemed to
    pass through his body, then, like a spring suddenly uncoiled,
    he sat up.</p>

    <p>He was fully conscious now and strove to rise to his feet.
    It was a tremendous effort, but he succeeded, and stood
    confronting Balcom, while the ominous light of hatred that
    gleamed from his eyes as they encountered those of Balcom made
    even that well-poised man recoil and shudder.</p>

    <p>With the muscles of his face working convulsively the dying
    thug tried to speak. All those standing in the library realized
    that it was to accuse, to denouce.</p>

    <p>However, the effort proved too great, and with a groan that
    was ghastly the man fell backward on the couch, dead.</p>

    <p>Murdering brute that he had been, still to Eva and Locke he
    now represented nothing but a stricken human being, with a
    human soul, blackened and warped. But Balcom and Paul seemed to
    show unmistakable signs of joy and relief. It was so evident,
    Locke thought, that he turned to them.</p>

    <p>"Your coming seemed to have an unfortunate effect," he
    hinted. "The man seemed to know one of you&mdash;at least."</p>

    <p>"Nothing of the kind," retorted Balcom, nettled.</p>

    <p>Locke turned to Paul and regarded his injured arm
    questioningly. Paul, however, never lost his accustomed
    aplomb.</p>

    <p>"I was hurt in an automobile accident," he explained, though
    with what seemed to be a trifle of nervousness.</p>

    <p>Locke turned to the doctor. He was rubbing his hands, and
    smiling, with great unction, an action very unbecoming, to say
    the least, in a medical man who had just lost a patient. Taken
    all in all, Locke felt he could now sense the web of conspiracy
    tightening around him. The cards were still in the hands of his
    enemies.</p>

    <p>He determined to incur any risk, to leave no stone unturned
    in order to bring the criminal to justice, whoever he might be.
    One thing encouraged him. The events seemed to have mollified
    Eva. He made an almost imperceptible signal to Eva, who left
    the room to dress for the street.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Locke left the library and went to a private
    telephone that connected the garage to the house. He ordered
    the chauffeur to have a fast runabout ready for instant call.
    Then, at the other telephone, he notified the coroner's office
    of the death of the emissary.</p>

    <p>By this time Balcom, Paul, and the doctor came out of the
    library, the doctor in high good humor, for had he not received
    a huge fee? He left in his car.</p>

    <p>Balcom and Paul, however, were slower in going, and paced
    the hallway in earnest conversation. Once they came to a dead
    halt close to the stairway leading down to the Graveyard of
    Genius. They listened intently. Evidently they came to a
    decision on something, for they left the house very
    hurriedly.</p>

    <p>Immediately Locke called for the runabout. Eva came running
    down-stairs and in a moment they took up the trail of the
    Balcom car.</p>

    <p>It seemed as if they traveled for miles, and Locke was
    commencing to think that it was merely a wild-goose chase, when
    Balcom's car came to a halt in one of the lower quarters of the
    city, before a house that was apparently tenantless.</p>

    <p>To avoid discovery, Locke backed his car around a corner,
    got out, and watched their movements from a safe distance.</p>

    <p>He saw Balcom, senior, alight, but Paul did not leave the
    car. Locke was in some quandary what to do. To attempt to enter
    the house without Paul's seeing him and raising the alarm
    would, he realized, be impossible. Therefore he waited for
    nearly half an hour before his patience was rewarded by seeing
    Balcom come out of the house, jump into the car, and drive off
    hurriedly with Paul.</p>

    <p>Locke walked to the house and looked closely over the
    exterior. It was little different from others in the same
    street. Then he walked thoughtfully back to Eva and they argued
    pro and con about the advisability of attempting to enter.</p>

    <p>Locke insisted on entering alone, but Eva would not hear of
    it. Therefore, it was decided that they would go in
    together.</p>

    <p>When Balcom had alighted from his car half an hour before he
    had merely stood for a moment in front of the door of the house
    when, mysteriously, the door had opened.</p>

    <p>There was no one in sight. But he was so familiar with the
    house that it might have been his own. He descended a flight of
    stairs and stood before another door, where the same
    door-opening process was repeated.</p>

    <p>Balcom entered a darkened room and for a moment seemed quite
    alone. Then from out the shadows, with a little half run, half
    lope, a strange figure of man came toward him.</p>

    <p>He was in reality large of frame, but stooped and bent with
    age. An old frock-coat was wrapped about him. But the most
    remarkable things about the man were a pair of weirdly
    fascinating eyes with a mad glint in them and an enormous full
    beard, snow white, that fell almost to his waist.</p>

    <p>At times the man talked rationally, in fact with the
    forcefulness of a great savant. Then, abruptly, he would leave
    off and the rest of his conversation was that of a babbling
    child. He was seldom at rest, scampering here and there, not
    unlike a bird-dog on a fresh scent. Seeking&mdash;always
    seeking&mdash;what?</p>

    <p>Balcom grasped his arm in order to arrest his attention.</p>

    <p>"Doctor Q," he addressed him, "you can have the revenge you
    have sought so long. Have you prepared everything?"</p>

    <p>The old man chuckled and wagged his head in senile fashion.
    Balcom grabbed both his shoulders so that the old man was
    facing him, and shook him slightly.</p>

    <p>"Your enemies are here," he emphasized. "Have you prepared
    for their reception?"</p>

    <p>And then the haze beclouding the old man's brain seemed to
    pass away and his next moments were lucid.</p>

    <p>"Ah, it's you, Balcom. You were just saying&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Balcom explained that Locke and Eva had tracked him and on
    his departure would undoubtedly enter to investigate the place.
    Doctor Q, for such was his odd name, understood now, and an
    evil grimace distorted his wrinkled face.</p>

    <p>"Let them come," he growled. "I am prepared. Why, I have
    even improved certain features of the Chair of Death."</p>

    <p>He led Balcom into an inner room where many electric bulbs
    were dimly glowing. At their entrance two brutal-looking men
    straightened up from their task and saluted Balcom with great
    deference. Then they resumed their tasks as electricians.</p>

    <p>"Want to see her work, sir?" one of the pair asked.</p>

    <p>Stepping around a partition that separated the knife-switch
    from the room in which stood the electric chair, Balcom
    watched.</p>

    <p>The chair was of practically the same construction as the
    chairs used in prisons for the supreme penalty, with electrodes
    to connect at the head, arms, and legs of the man to be
    electrocuted.</p>

    <p>"Stand back, sir," called one of the men as he shot the
    switch home.</p>

    <p>Instantly a snapping sound was heard as the current surged
    through, and the crackling sound such as the now familiar
    wireless makes as the long sparks leap from pole to pole. It
    was Force.</p>

    <p>A satisfied look came into Balcom's eyes and he warmly
    congratulated the mad inventor, who followed him to the door
    and watched him as he mounted the stairs to depart with his
    son.</p>

    <p>Soon after the departure Doctor Q went to a strange-looking
    instrument that seemed to have many of the characteristics of
    the periscope. He pulled a lever, a panel opened, and
    immediately the space directly in front of his street door was
    revealed to him. He stood there, watching intently, much as a
    spider watches for a fly.</p>

    <p>Soon Locke and Eva showed in the panel above. He next
    pressed a button and saw the two enter. Then he went to a huge
    divan on the other side of the room and whipped off a covering
    that was concealing some gigantic thing beneath.</p>

    <p>It was the Automaton, prostrate, at full length, without
    motion. At least it seemed so.</p>

    <p>The madman glanced around, and then glided into an inner
    room from the larger one. He was just in time, for a moment
    later Locke and Eva entered.</p>

    <p>They, too, glanced around fearfully. They saw the dread form
    of the Automaton and, although it did not move, Locke would
    have admitted he was ready to beat a retreat.</p>

    <p>It was uncanny, weird. In the dim light the monster seemed
    to assume gigantic proportions. But he lay so still that their
    jangling nerves became quieted. They even approached him, Locke
    with automatic in hand in case the iron terror were shamming.
    But there was no sign of life&mdash;or whatever it was that
    animated this thing.</p>

    <p>Locke, handing his gun to Eva, determined to investigate
    further. He went to the inner door and listened. But he could
    hear no sound. He turned the knob and entered. He was amazed at
    what he saw. But, as there was apparently no living thing
    about, he took courage and entered farther. He took note of the
    switches, saw the deadly chair, and was about to test the
    apparatus to see if it could be possible that a practical
    electric chair existed in the heart of a peaceful city, when he
    heard Eva shriek in heart-rending terror.</p>

    <p>He rushed madly back to where he had left her. But as he
    passed through the door some one dealt him a blow on the head,
    and as though pole-axed he dropped to the floor.</p>

    <p>After Locke had left her to go into the inner room Eva's
    fears revived and she wished to follow him. But she was ashamed
    to have him think her a coward. She forced herself to remain
    rooted to the spot.</p>

    <p>Her eyes had followed Locke through the doorway and her ears
    were strained to hear the faintest sound from the other room.
    In her anxiety about Locke's safety she even forgot the
    Automaton, and, in turning the better to watch the doorway, she
    drew nearer to the divan upon which the monster lay.</p>

    <p>It was this action that had brought her into peril. Slowly
    one of the monster's arms commenced to move, and before Eva
    could spring away she was enfolded in his deadly embrace. It
    was that that made her shriek madly, wildly, in utter
    terror.</p>

    <p>Then she saw Locke running through the door to her, saw him
    struck from behind, and she fainted.</p>

    <p>The Automaton, evidently thinking Eva dead, let her limp
    body slip to the floor. For a moment it towered over her, as
    though contemplating whether to trample on her or no. At this
    juncture an emissary distracted its attention and the terror
    left her lying there without further injury.</p>

    <p>The Automaton now assumed command of Locke's
    electrocution.</p>

    <p>Under its direction the emissaries picked up Locke's body
    and placed it in the electric chair. They slit his trousers so
    that the deadly electrodes might form a better contact with his
    flesh. His sleeves were rolled back for the same reason. Next
    the headpiece was firmly adjusted. Now all the straps were
    tightly clinched.</p>

    <p>The Automaton waved his arm.</p>

    <p>A man stepped to the switch.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

    <p>There was a moan from the front room. Eva was recovering
    from her faint. The Automaton indicated to the emissary at the
    switch to do nothing until he had found out what was going
    on.</p>

    <p>Locke had, meanwhile, recovered consciousness and realized
    his awful position. Here was a situation which, on its face,
    seemed unescapable. Yet Locke would not give in.</p>

    <p>Straining every effort, he tried to extricate himself before
    the deadly current could sever the thread of life. Seconds
    seemed ages. Still he tried.</p>

    <p>With a mighty effort he strained every muscle of his
    gigantic chest and the very straps that held him groaned from
    the force of his muscular exertion. Even now the death-man was
    at the switch and it was barely a question of seconds or
    heart-beats between him and death.</p>

    <p>With a quick twist of his giant shoulder he threw his whole
    weight against the chest strap and it parted. Lurching forward,
    he freed his head and neck from the cruel straps, which snapped
    and parted.</p>

    <p>The death-man paused for a fraction of a second to see what
    caused the commotion in the chair. To that pause Locke owed his
    life. With a final supreme effort he threw himself on the floor
    just as the knife-switch swung into position and the wicked
    blue flame of death leaped across the head electrodes.</p>

    <p>Once freed, he catapulted himself across the room and with a
    vicious upper-cut sent the emissary sprawling unconscious to
    the floor. Without a thought of himself he rushed into the next
    room where Eva now stood in panic, glued to the spot, in fear
    of the Frankenstein monster that would crush her in its
    grasp.</p>

    <p>With murderous mien the thing crossed the room slowly, until
    only the table stood between her and destruction.</p>

    <p>Like a wild animal Locke hurled himself into the room and
    with a master stroke of quick wit flung the heavy oaken table
    over at the monster. Then he seized Eva, and before the monster
    could turn in its tracks, half dragged, half carried her from
    the room.</p>

    <p>In the hall further difficulty confronted Locke, for the
    place was well guarded. Several henchmen darted forth from dark
    corners of the murky place and would have intercepted him.</p>

    <p>As the first approached, Locke, with a quick jiu-jitsu
    thrust, hurled him for a fall that would have broken the back
    of a less hardy man. The next one was just turning the top of
    the stairs, and Locke, quick to take advantage of the
    situation, adopted the only means of escape.</p>

    <p>He seized the man bodily about the waist and, lifting him
    over his head, threw him upon his other oncoming foe. The
    result was that the two were flung down the stairs.</p>

    <p>"Run!" he cried to Eva in a voice that was a command.</p>

    <p>Without waiting he picked her up and carried her over the
    sprawling mass of legs and arms to safety below.</p>

    <p>Once outside, he felt a little embarrassed at having the
    beautiful girl in his arms and he half murmured an apology as
    he placed her feet gently on the ground.</p>

    <p>Life at Brent Rock was far from monotonous.</p>

    <p>Like a great game of checkers, the various members of the
    establishment were being moved about, guided by some strange
    hand, it seemed.</p>

    <p>Now one, then another seemed to gain the advantage, and as
    each strove for control of the vast fortune, the battle of wits
    surged back and forth.</p>

    <p>Balcom was playing a game, it was plain. But to what extent?
    Sometimes it seemed as though Zita was his aide and would stop
    at nothing to succeed. Again it was that Zita played the game
    alone, still fostering her secret but hopeless love for Locke.
    Again it seemed as if Paul were playing the game, either alone
    or with some one else.</p>

    <p>Just now it was apparent that Balcom and Zita, for their own
    ends, whatever might be the identity of the Automaton, planned
    a coup for themselves.</p>

    <p>During one of Locke's absences Zita had secured access to
    his laboratory, and while looking around had discovered the
    dictagraph hidden in the desk drawer. Often Balcom and Zita,
    either together or alone, had taken advantage of the
    discovery.</p>

    <p>It was at a time when both were using the mechanical
    eavesdropper on Locke and Eva in the library that Locke
    suddenly decided to return to the laboratory, without saying
    anything about it.</p>

    <p>Zita's quick ear heard him down the hall.</p>

    <p>"Quick!" she warned. "Some one is coming!"</p>

    <p>She sprang toward the closet door, which stood ajar, and in
    an instant Balcom was with her. The two were concealed in the
    closet as the laboratory door opened and Locke entered.</p>

    <p>Locke walked to his table of test-tubes and picked up one
    containing mercury. What prompted this action he did not know.
    Perhaps it was his fascination for the elusive metal. Perhaps
    it was some subconscious feeling. At any rate, he held it aloft
    and gazed at it in the light. As he did so a strange thing
    happened. Reflected in its surface on the glass, yet distorted
    like a convex mirror, he could see the door of the closet open
    just a crack and the evil faces of Balcom and Zita peer
    out.</p>

    <p>He did not move nor did he in any way betray what he saw,
    but nonchalantly set the tube of precious metal down and
    pretended to seek something from the table. He turned slowly
    and retraced his steps to the library below, where he entered,
    holding his fingers to his lips in warning to Eva not to speak.
    He walked quickly over to a writing-desk, took a pencil, and
    began to write.</p>

    <p>"Balcom and Zita are listening on the dictagraph. Pretend to
    quarrel with me."</p>

    <p>Eva read in amazement as he wrote. Quickly she comprehended.
    Then they walked silently until they were almost under the
    chandelier which held the transmitter of the dictagraph.</p>

    <p>"I have something I want to say to you, Mr. Locke," began
    Eva, with a wink and a smile at him, "and it grieves me to say
    it."</p>

    <p>"What is it?" asked Locke, with distinct anxiety, winking
    back.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid I shall have to dispense with your services,"
    continued Eva, as she reached out her hand and gave Locke's a
    little squeeze.</p>

    <p>Up-stairs, Balcom and Zita listened intently, their heads
    close together so that each could catch every word. Balcom was
    nodding with satisfaction. Each looked at the other as though
    they could hardly believe their ears.</p>

    <p>"But I have tried to serve and protect you," protested
    Locke, as his face wreathed in smiles at Eva, who was carrying
    the deception off perfectly. Then he added, plaintively, "I am
    sorry that I have failed."</p>

    <p>"Your protection has led me into danger," returned Eva, in
    her best voice to denote anger, "and your seeming interest is
    out of place&mdash;and, besides, <i>Mr.</i> Locke, Paul Balcom
    does not like your being here. You know he is the man I am to
    marry."</p>

    <p>As she said this, Eva looked roguishly at him. Locke's face
    clouded a little, although he knew it was only in a joke.</p>

    <p>"But, Miss Brent," he continued to protest, "I had
    hoped&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Not another word, Mr. Locke," interrupted Eva, as she edged
    very close to him and gazed into his eyes. "Please leave this
    house at once&mdash;I hate you!" And, not suiting the action to
    the word, she reached out and gave his hand a squeeze that told
    more than words what her true thoughts in the matter were.</p>

    <p>Locke leaned over and was on the point of kissing her when
    she held up her hand and pointed to the receiver above in the
    chandelier as if it really had eyes as well as ears. He looked
    up and was forced to check a laugh lest it be heard by the
    listeners above.</p>

    <p>In the laboratory, Balcom had heard enough. He turned to
    Zita, and with a hurried command told her to go
    down-stairs.</p>

    <p>"Keep an eye on him and tell me where he goes," was the
    parting instruction of Balcom as the two separated on the
    stairs at the very time that Paul blustered in the front
    door.</p>

    <p>"Morning, Governor," nodded Paul, as he gave his hat to the
    butler.</p>

    <p>"A very good morning, Paul," emphasized Balcom, quite
    unctuously, as he went on to tell his son of the supposed
    quarrel between Eva and Locke which he had overheard.</p>

    <p>A light of triumph came into Paul's eyes. Eva's happiness,
    even her life, meant nothing to him. She was merely a means to
    his own evil ends and he now felt sure that he held her in his
    grasp. Besides, in so far as such a selfish nature can care for
    another human being, Paul cared for De Luxe Dora. There was a
    fascination for him in her tigerish, unscrupulous nature that a
    good woman could never inspire.</p>

    <p>And now, as he eagerly listened to his father, he visualized
    new motor-cars, a yacht, rivers of champagne, a life of mad
    gaiety with his favorite pals, men and women.</p>

    <p>Locke, in the library, was laughing quietly with Eva over
    the success of the ruse. But there was, notwithstanding, an
    undercurrent of seriousness running through their thoughts.
    For, although they had scored against their adversaries in
    misleading them as to their intentions, both realized that
    Balcom was a tremendously clever man, astute and wise beyond
    the average in the ways of the world, and that the slightest
    lack of caution, the smallest flaw in the acting of the parts
    they had elected to play, would inevitably lose for them the
    advantage they had gained.</p>

    <p>They went into the most minute details of the plans they had
    formulated, and they realized that in order to keep the wool
    pulled over Balcom's and Paul's eyes it was necessary that they
    separate, at least apparently, for a few days. Locke gave out
    that he was to seek evidence in the lower quarters of the city,
    while Eva was to play the game at home. It was to Eva that the
    more difficult role fell.</p>

    <p>Locke bade her an affectionate farewell and left by a door
    opposite to the one leading to the main hallway, where the
    voices of Paul and his father were now audible.</p>

    <p>Eva opened the hallway door and greeted Paul, feigning
    delight and chiding him for his long absence&mdash;which had
    not been even a day&mdash;intimating that there must be some
    woman in whom he was interested. She made a pretty show of
    jealousy.</p>

    <p>Paul, wearing his vanity on his sleeve, was delighted and
    his eyes shone with satisfaction. He took a step forward and
    attempted to take Eva in his arms. But she evaded him
    playfully, while he pursued her. Finally she could bear no
    more. The game revolted her. She made the excuse that she must
    attend her father, and ran up-stairs.</p>

    <p>So a day or two passed, days which were sheer torture to
    Eva. Paul called every day, bringing her little gifts, and it
    must be acknowledged that he showed exquisite taste.</p>

    <p>They took long walks together. On horseback they cantered
    all over the country. Friends called, and it was at such times
    that Eva found her only relief from Paul's attentions. Many a
    rubber of bridge she played just to escape being alone with
    him.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

    <p>At last, late one afternoon, the faithful old butler
    announced to Eva privately that Locke was on the wire and
    wished to speak to her.</p>

    <p>Eva almost ran to the telephone, and her hand shook with
    sheer joy as she took the receiver.</p>

    <p>"Yes, everything is moving along even more rapidly than I
    expected," replied Locke to her eager inquiry. "Whenever Paul
    leaves Brent Rock he goes directly to a miserable café and
    there I see him with a number of people of the underworld. He
    seems to have a great deal of influence over them. I'm sifting
    all the clues, and as soon as I unmask him I will send for
    you."</p>

    <p>Eva gave him a brief outline of how she had fared in his
    absence and an account of her father's condition, which was now
    very bad. Everything the doctor had done seemed to be without
    effect.</p>

    <p>Locke assured her that he hoped soon to lay hands on the
    antidote that would restore Brent to health and sanity, and
    begged Eva to be brave in the mean time.</p>

    <p>When the conversation was over Eva felt certain that no one
    had overheard what she and Quentin had said. But she was
    mistaken, as she was to learn at her cost. For, far down in the
    bowels of the earth, in the den of the Automaton, an emissary
    had tapped in on the telephone wire and had heard every
    word.</p>

    <p>Down-town, among the haunts of Paul, on the west side, was
    the Black Tom Café. Every attempt had been made to make the
    place bizarre. About the walls were palings that represented a
    back fence, along which crawled painted black cats in every
    conceivable state&mdash;a rather odd conceit for a cabaret.</p>

    <p>Although the sun had not yet set, the electric lights were
    already agleam. On a raised platform three weary-eyed musicians
    were pounding and thumping out the latest Broadway hit.</p>

    <p>There were not half a dozen people in the place, and these
    were obviously denizens of this quarter of the town. They were
    listless and weary, mere shells of human beings. And yet it was
    such as these that the slumming parties at night romantically
    dubbed bohemians.</p>

    <p>They showed scant interest as De Luxe Dora, unaccompanied
    for once, swept into the place. Dora was gorgeously and
    flashily dressed and fairly scintillated with jewels. She
    seated herself not far from the door and ordered a cocktail.
    Then she whistled a bar of music suggestively to the
    piano-player, who immediately caught it, and the "orchestra"
    with a show of animation strummed out her suggestion. She sent
    over drinks for them and was rewarded with more song hits.</p>

    <p>Jauntily now Paul came in. A couple of men roused themselves
    and slouched over to him. They held a whispered conversation,
    and Paul was insistent on some point. He evidently had his way,
    for the men slunk back to their places and, sprawling out, were
    in a moment as listless as before.</p>

    <p>Paul nodded to Dora in greeting, but she turned her back. He
    gave a low whistle of astonishment and went over to her.</p>

    <p>"Say, Dora, why the grouch?" he asked.</p>

    <p>For a moment she disdained to answer and glared at him
    witheringly. Then she blurted out, "You're throwing me down for
    that baby face with the money!"</p>

    <p>Paul gave a short laugh and shrugged his shoulders. "Don't
    be silly," he laughed. "She'll be our meal-ticket."</p>

    <p>He sat down, and over a couple more cocktails he had Dora
    quite mollified.</p>

    <p>A few moments later Locke entered and slipped quickly into a
    chair, since he did not wish to be seen. In his hand he carried
    a newspaper which he now unfolded and held up in front of him
    so that it hid his face. Next he poked a hole through the
    center of the sheet so that he could see without being
    seen.</p>

    <p>At this moment, seemingly in all earnestness, Paul and Dora
    resumed their quarrel, and Dora's strident voice echoed through
    the café.</p>

    <p>"If you throw me down you'd better look out," she
    bawled.</p>

    <p>Paul jumped up, and for a moment it looked as though he
    would strike her. But he changed his mind, cursed her, and
    finally stalked out of the café.</p>

    <p>Locke folded his paper, paid his bill to the sleepy waiter,
    and started after Paul. At the entrance he stopped, thought a
    moment, and then went directly to Dora's table and sat
    down.</p>

    <p>"Why, what are you doing here?" she gasped, in great
    surprise. "Don't you know that you may be <i>killed</i>?"</p>

    <p>"It's a risk that I must run," replied Locke. "But tell
    me&mdash;you tried to kill me once&mdash;why?"</p>

    <p>"Because I was a fool, controlled by my love for Paul
    Balcom&mdash;the beast! I hate him!"</p>

    <p>Dora drank viciously, then, with jealous venom, leaned over
    to Locke, and asked, "If that girl, Eva Brent, finds out about
    him, will she throw him over?"</p>

    <p>Locke played the game diplomatically, and apparently
    succeeded in further incensing Dora against her lover, for,
    suddenly she jumped up.</p>

    <p>"Meet me here in an hour. I'll have everything arranged to
    spoil Paul Balcom's game," she whispered, as she swept out of
    the café with demi-mondaine majesty.</p>

    <p>Locke was elated at the thought of having won so powerful an
    enemy to his side. But, had he heard Dora's remark to Paul as
    she met him around a convenient corner, his elation would have
    given way to caution.</p>

    <p>Paul eagerly questioned her with a glance as she
    approached.</p>

    <p>"Well, he fell for it," she announced, toughly, then added,
    "just as you fell for his dictagraph game with the girl."</p>

    <p>There was just a bit of jealousy yet in the tone of Dora.
    She was not yet convinced of her complete triumph over Eva.</p>

    <p>At the same time Locke left the café and entered a
    telephone-booth, from which he called up Eva.</p>

    <p>"Come to the Black Tom immediately," he said. "Dora is now
    on our side and we'll learn the truth, she promises."</p>

    <p>Eva at once started to get ready so that she would arrive at
    the time Locke had fixed, while he loitered in the
    neighborhood, waiting until the hour agreed upon with Dora was
    almost gone.</p>

    <p>Dora was already waiting for him outside the place when he
    returned to the Black Tom.</p>

    <p>"How is everything?" inquired Locke.</p>

    <p>"All arranged. You'll get Paul right."</p>

    <p>Just then a man slouched past.</p>

    <p>"Follow that fellow," whispered Dora.</p>

    <p>Locke nodded and did so.</p>

    <p>The man proceeded into the café and Locke followed. But
    instead of sitting down in the main room the man passed through
    into an inner room. Locke followed. He looked about. It seemed
    to be a sort of storeroom, as nearly as he could make out.</p>

    <p>His guide pressed a secret panel and, stepping through an
    aperture, beckoned Locke to follow. Locke drew his automatic
    and went ahead in the inky blackness that lay beyond the panel.
    The next moment the very floor under his feet seemed to give
    way. He felt himself thrown down bodily into a sort of
    subcellar.</p>

    <p>Locke was immediately pounced upon by lurking emissaries who
    seized him after a terrific battle and held him firmly.</p>

    <p>"Where's a rope?" growled one.</p>

    <p>There was no answer as the men struggled. The question was
    repeated. Apparently one of them looked about.</p>

    <p>"Use the wire," he growled.</p>

    <p>The questioner gave a grunt of brutal satisfaction. There in
    this storeroom lay a huge roll of barbed wire. Coil after coil
    of this barbed wire was wound about Locke as he struggled, but
    ever more feebly, for with each coil now the barbs began to cut
    cruelly into his flesh.</p>

    <p>Some one lighted a candle and by its light he saw many
    carboys of acid standing in a row.</p>

    <p>Directly behind them, so that there could be no doubt of the
    horrible fate in store for him, stood the Automaton.</p>

    <p>Already at the entrance to the Black Tom Café Eva's speedy
    runabout came to a stop. Dora was at the curb to meet her and
    was all winning smiles.</p>

    <p>Instinctively Eva shrank from this overdressed woman. But it
    had been Locke's desire that she come to this place, and she
    decided to follow the woman, for would it not lead to the
    unmasking of Paul, whom she hated?</p>

    <p>Once or twice on the descent into the café Eva hesitated,
    but was gently urged on by Dora.</p>

    <p>Eva was utterly disgusted by the flotsam and jetsam in human
    guise that she found sprawling at the tables, but she decided
    to brave the place.</p>

    <p>"Wait a moment and I'll get Mr. Locke," smiled Dora.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the better to blot out the distasteful scene,
    Eva closed her eyes.</p>

    <p>When she opened them again it was to look into the
    ferocious, bestial face of the giant emissary who, with fingers
    clutched like the talons of some foul bird, was reaching toward
    her to grasp her by the throat.</p>

    <p>In the noisome cellar Locke lay as though fascinated by the
    dread form that confronted him, as well as by its more dreadful
    purpose.</p>

    <p>The Automaton drew back its massive foot and deliberately
    kicked over one after another of the carboys.</p>

    <p>A pungent odor at once permeated the cellar air as the acid
    ate into the floor.</p>

    <p>Its purpose accomplished, the Automaton stalked toward
    Locke, and stood towering above him.</p>

    <p>Would it crush out Locke's life under its ponderous heel? Or
    would it leave him to a death more horrible?</p>

    <p>Like writhing serpents, the rivulets of seething, burning
    acid crept closer, closer.</p>

        in the path of the deadly acid
    </div>

    <h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

    <p>The Automaton and its emissaries left the cellar. In the
    distance a door slammed and Locke was left to his terrible
    fate.</p>

    <p>Except for the gurgling of the flowing acid and the
    scampering of the rats all was silent.</p>

    <p>Locke tried to move. But the sharp barbs of the wire cut
    into his flesh, a torture to test the fortitude of a stoic.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Locke had barely recovered from the shock of his
    fall into the cellar. Thus for a few seconds that seemed to him
    to be ages he lay there watching the fiery death creep closer.
    Then the will to live surged through him and he struggled
    furiously to escape from the deadly path of the acid. Gone now
    was his flinching and shrinking as the sharp barbs lacerated
    his tender flesh. Gone was the calmness that denoted surrender
    and the acceptance of his fate.</p>

    <p>With bunching muscles he writhed inch by inch to one side,
    out of the path of the flow of the acid. He was just in time,
    for, at his last mighty effort, the consuming fluid flowed
    past, not an inch from his face.</p>

    <p>To extricate himself from the coils of the wire was a slow
    and painful task. Wounded with a hundred wounds, with each
    movement of his body adding a further injury, many times Locke
    was forced to desist in his efforts to free himself. However,
    he persisted, though, strong man that he was, the tears of
    agony burned his eyes and beads of cold sweat stood on his brow
    even before the first coil was loosened.</p>

    <p>He could not, even to save his own life, have persisted in
    this self-inflicted torture had it not been for the thought of
    Eva hurrying to this dreadful den. That thought almost drove
    him mad and spurred him to furious effort.</p>

    <p>It was well that it did. For at this very moment the beastly
    emissary in the café above was closing in on her.</p>

    <p>Locke gave a final heave and tugged at the last strands of
    the wire that held him prisoner. His clothes ripped to tatters
    and his flesh torn and lacerated, he at last stood free.</p>

    <p>Without an instant's pause he collected packing-cases and
    even barrels. He stacked them one upon the other, pyramiding
    them under the trap-door through which he had fallen into the
    cellar. Then he climbed upon them, leaped, and tried to grasp
    the edge of the floor above him, but fell short and came
    tumbling down amid the boxes and barrels, only to start
    stacking them up all over again.</p>

    <p>Finally he managed to grasp the edge of the floor with one
    hand and draw himself up. For a few moments he lay panting on
    the floor, then groped for the panel through which he had
    entered not half an hour before. It was locked, but a shrewd
    kick above the lock opened it to him and he rushed through the
    storeroom and out into the now brilliantly lighted café.</p>

    <p>He was barely in time.</p>

    <p>The emissary already had Eva in his grasp and was choking
    her into unconsciousness. The foul habitués of the resort, far
    from aiding the poor girl, seemed for the first time that day
    to be showing interest and to be thoroughly enjoying the brutal
    sight.</p>

    <p>With a shout Locke charged. His right swing landed just
    behind the emissary's ear and the man dropped, pulling Eva down
    with him. But Locke had her up and behind him in a second.</p>

    <p>Three other emissaries appeared as though by magic and
    attacked him on all sides.</p>

    <p>Locke's automatic had been lost when he fell into the
    cellar. Consequently he grabbed up one of the café chairs,
    which he wielded like a club.</p>

    <p>One emissary had worked around until he was at one side of
    Locke and almost behind him, a blackjack raised in his hand.
    But Eva warned Locke in time. Whirling about, he made a full
    swing with the chair and caught the emissary full in the face
    with it. The man went down and stayed down.</p>

         the fight in the cafe after the escape from the acid
    </div>

    <p>"Run quick as you can," panted Locke to Eva. "Get the car
    started."</p>

    <p>She was reluctant to leave him, and Locke saw that delay was
    dangerous. He hurled what remained of the chair into the faces
    of the last two emissaries, then turned and rushed up the
    steps, carrying Eva along with him.</p>

    <p>A whir of the starter, the throbbing of the engine as the
    gas in the cylinders ignited, and they were streaking toward
    Brent Rock, safe.</p>

    <p>In a still fashionable, but older, part of the town, the
    elder Balcom had his quarters. They were spacious and furnished
    in Oriental style, with many a suggestion of the Indian
    Ocean.</p>

    <p>Balcom was evidently annoyed, and seriously so. He was
    striding up and down the apartment, scowling and puffing
    furiously at a black cigar. In his hand was a letter, and from
    time to time he halted and glanced at it, then fell back to his
    quick walking again, while a sinister light came into his eyes.
    Yet the contents of the note were hardly such as would have
    seemed likely to cause a man of honest purpose any
    agitation.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">Mr. Herbert Balcom,</span><br />
         <span style="margin-left: 2em;">International Patents,
        Inc.</span></p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;A special
        meeting of the executive board of International Patents,
        Inc., will be called at Brent Rock this afternoon to
        determine the future policies of this company.</p>

        <p class="author">[Signed]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span class="smcap">Eva Brent.</span></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Balcom had read the notice for the tenth time when a negro
    servant entered and announced that his son Paul wished to see
    him.</p>

    <p>"Show him in&mdash;then," growled Balcom to the servant.</p>

    <p>Paul entered. He was evidently somewhat chagrined and
    crestfallen. Nor did his father's next words tend to cheer him
    up.</p>

    <p>"I suppose you'll acknowledge that you've made a miserable
    mess of it," accused the older man. "When will you stop mixing
    women with business?"</p>

    <p>Paul was silent. Indeed there was nothing that he could
    say.</p>

    <p>"And now look at this note," pursued Balcom, in growing
    rage. "It brings things to a head. What can we do?"</p>

    <p>He thrust the note at Paul, who read it. Balcom himself
    reread it, crumpled it in anger, tore it, and threw the pieces
    in violence on the floor.</p>

    <p>This time it was to be Paul who was to formulate a plan. It
    was of such a dark and criminal nature that even Herbert
    Balcom, hardened as he was himself, was for the moment appalled
    at his son's temerity. But as he listened to Paul's words they
    fascinated him and he leaned forward the better to take in the
    scheme.</p>

    <p>As Paul and his father planned, it seemed that here was
    power unlimited, wealth beyond all counting and without the
    possibility of discovery. For, like most men of his caliber,
    the approbation of the community was dear to Balcom.</p>

    <p>"Good, Paul!" approved Balcom. "Go to it at once."</p>

    <p>Paul looked keenly at his father.</p>

    <p>"Haven't you anything to add?"</p>

    <p>"No, I have nothing to advise. The scheme is perfect, and as
    you conceived it you can also execute it. The best of luck to
    you, my boy."</p>

    <p>A few moments later Paul went out, his dark face beaming at
    being reinstated in his father's good graces. He was full of
    his plan.</p>

    <p>Down in one of the city's worst sections and near the
    river-front there stood an old ramshackle building. Why it had
    not been condemned by the building inspectors was a mystery.
    But it stood in all its squalid ugliness. The door and the
    windows were locked and shuttered. One could see at a glance
    that the building had been long unused.</p>

    <p>There was an alley strewn with tin cans and other refuse
    leading to the back of the house, and it was down a flight of
    broken brick steps that Old Meg, the fortune-teller, had her
    den where through the superstitions of those inhabiting the
    neighborhood she managed to eke out a miserable existence. The
    interior of the den was unspeakably filthy. The furniture
    consisted of a broken-down couch, a chest of drawers in a like
    condition, a card-table, a few kitchen chairs, and some boxes.
    Most of the panes in the windows had been broken and the empty
    spaces had been covered with old newspapers. Consequently, a
    candle thrust into an old wine-bottle supplied the only real
    light.</p>

    <p>At the table, idly shuffling a pack of grimy cards, sat Old
    Meg, a horrible old hag, wrinkled in face like a mummy, with
    only the stumps of teeth which had more the appearance of
    tusks. Her unkempt hair was matted and ugly wisps of it hung
    down over her bleary eyes. For clothes she wore an
    old-fashioned faded gingham wrapper and around her shoulders a
    dirty torn shawl. On her feet was a pair of man's shoes, many
    sizes too large, which had evidently been cast away as useless
    by some former owner, himself squalid. These she managed to
    keep on by tying the tops with wrapping-cord. A more unlovely
    human being it would have been hard to find in all the great
    city. There she sat, crooning a ballad to herself in a high,
    cracked voice. It sounded like an incantation.</p>

    <p>A step sounded in the alley and Old Meg looked up and
    listened intently. The sound came nearer. She got up and
    retreated into a dark corner, for she knew the neighborhood
    well, and many a time some thug, brutal with drink, had entered
    her den and wrung her last few pennies from her.</p>

    <p>But it was no inhabitant of this quarter of the town who
    entered this time. It was Paul Balcom.</p>

    <p>The hag grinned in a horrible way at him, for it was not
    unusual for people of his kind to visit her and it always meant
    money. With her apron she dusted off the chair that stood at
    the table and begged him to be seated. Then she shuffled the
    cards and cut, shuffled and cut, and then as though at last
    satisfied she laid them face downward on the table and
    spoke.</p>

    <p>"Wish, my handsome gentleman, and may your wish come
    true."</p>

    <p>"Go ahead with the hocus-pocus," growled Paul.</p>

    <p>Mother Meg picked up one card after another and her cracked
    voice was evidently following a set formula.</p>

    <p>"If the queen of spades comes between the king of clubs and
    the queen of hearts&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Paul listened with a strained intentness as the hag
    singsonged on and on. Then a look of satisfaction came into his
    eyes and he smiled happily. Next his look changed to a nasty
    look of determination, and he abruptly got up, tossing a
    bank-note on the table which Old Meg grabbed with avidity,
    calling down Heaven's blessings on the handsome gentleman until
    Paul, running up-stairs, could hear no more.</p>

    <p>Paul returned immediately to his father's apartment, where
    Balcom was impatiently waiting for him. He described minutely
    Old Meg, her eagerness for money, and the squalid quarters in
    which she lived. The elder Balcom seemed satisfied and they
    left the apartment together.</p>

    <p>"Paul," directed Balcom, "get out to Brent Rock as soon as
    you can while I make arrangements with this Old Meg."</p>

    <p>Balcom stepped into his own car, while Paul hailed a
    taxicab, and a few minutes later Balcom alighted before the
    house of Old Meg. He walked down the alley and descended into
    the den.</p>

    <p>As before, Meg was in hiding in a dark corner until she
    could ascertain just who her visitor might be. Seeing Balcom,
    she came out and courtesied and scraped as she had for
    Paul.</p>

    <p>Balcom announced the object of his visit immediately, and
    while he was speaking he fingered a roll of bills which he had
    taken from his pocket the better to arouse the old hag's
    avariciousness.</p>

    <p>It had the desired effect and her eyes fairly gleamed with
    the craving of possession.</p>

    <p>"Do as I tell you, Meg," directed Balcom, "and I'll make you
    rich. Do you understand? Rich!" he emphasized, rolling out the
    last word silkily on his tongue.</p>

    <p>Old Meg's last scruples, had she ever had even one, fell
    before this temptation and she became almost the slave of
    Balcom.</p>

    <p>Balcom now gave a command and the old hag sidled to the door
    of an inner room.</p>

    <p>"Jimmy! Jimmy!" she called. "Come here to me."</p>

    <p>In a moment a boy slunk into the room. He was sharp-faced,
    pinched for food, and in tatters, as disreputable-looking as
    the hag herself. Meg whispered something to him, and, as though
    galvanized by an electric current, the boy shot up-stairs. He
    was soon back again with two brutal-looking men who looked
    suspiciously at Balcom and then shuffled into a corner, where
    they conferred eagerly with Old Meg.</p>

    <p>At first it was plain to be seen that they were refusing to
    do her bidding, but Meg made a movement as though she were
    counting money. After that it was equally plain that they
    agreed.</p>

    <p>Meg sidled over to Balcom and he unwrapped a few bills of
    large denomination and handed them to her. She immediately hid
    them in her dress, with many a furtive look toward her
    accomplices.</p>

    <p>Balcom's eyes followed those of the old hag, and, realizing
    that his whole conspiracy might fail unless the men were
    assured of further reward on the completion of their task, he
    approached them smoothly.</p>

    <p>"Of course," he insinuated, "you understand that if you
    three follow instructions to the letter I'll double that
    amount." Then he left the place, brushing his coat with his
    handkerchief as he did so. "Brent Rock," he said to his
    chauffeur, curtly, as he stepped into his car.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

    <p>Eva and Locke were seated at a long table in the library of
    Eva's home. Before them were many ledgers of International
    Patents, Incorporated. Eva was reading certain entries in the
    books, while Locke was making notes to be used at the coming
    directors' meeting.</p>

    <p>Eva closed the ledger from which she had been reading and
    announced, "I intend, at the meeting, to insist that the
    patents held in the Graveyard of Genius be released to the
    world."</p>

    <p>"It is the only honorable thing to do," agreed Locke. "You
    will undoubtedly meet with violent opposition from Balcom and
    some few who owe their fortunes to him, but in the end you will
    win."</p>

    <p>"If we could only have found the antidote," sighed Eva, "and
    my father could only be again in control of things."</p>

    <p>"All we can do is to act as we think he would have acted if
    he were in control," soothed Locke.</p>

    <p>"May I speak to you a moment, Mr. Locke?" interrupted a
    voice.</p>

    <p>It was Zita who had entered noiselessly and now stood well
    within the room.</p>

    <p>How long had she been there? How much had she overheard?
    Both Eva and Quentin exchanged worried glances.</p>

    <p>Locke rose and went over to Zita, who spoke to him in a
    whispered undertone.</p>

    <p>The matter was so trivial that it hardly warranted her
    intrusion. Locke was puzzled. But he was a man and, therefore,
    did not understand. For, as Zita continued, there was a world
    of longing in her eyes. She even went so far as to finger the
    lapel of his coat.</p>

    <p>Eva understood only too well, and her face crimsoned. She
    bit her lips, and in vexation at Zita her finger-nails pressed
    into her palms. Paul's entrance at this moment was a distinct
    relief, much as she despised the man.</p>

    <p>"What's all the fuss about?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>Paul had a gaiety of manner that he could slip on like a
    coat, and it was this quality that made him dangerous. He was
    popular and attractive.</p>

    <p>Paul took Eva's hand and managed to hold it just the
    fraction of a second longer than was necessary to convey
    friendship. Then Eva withdrew her hand, but not before Locke
    saw it and scowled.</p>

    <p>It was not long before the elder Balcom also arrived.</p>

    <p>"Good afternoon, my children," he greeted, jovially. "I'm
    just a bit ahead of time, I imagine. But why you children don't
    leave dry matters of business to us older heads I'm blessed if
    I know."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Balcom," retorted Eva, keenly, "the older head that
    would protect my interests and the interests of those poor
    inventors lies stricken, as you know, in the room above. In his
    absence the children, as you are pleased to call us, will do
    their best."</p>

    <p>Balcom glared, while Zita with a strange glance toward Eva
    left Locke and joined Balcom in a far corner of the room.</p>

    <p>"Zita," Balcom whispered, "the time has arrived to take you
    out of this false position."</p>

    <p>Zita trembled with suppressed excitement as she heard this,
    and followed Balcom back toward the table, where the others
    were already seating themselves.</p>

    <p>It was approaching the hour, when Eva rose and was about to
    speak. Balcom motioned and stopped her with a gesture.</p>

    <p>"One moment, please, Miss Brent," he interrupted. "Before
    the others arrive I am going to establish Zita's real position
    in this house."</p>

    <p>All at the table looked at one another in openly expressed
    astonishment. Zita, with eyes cast down, hands clasped in her
    lap, seemed almost demure, though about her mouth played a
    faint smile.</p>

    <p>Even Paul did not understand this phase of the conspiracy
    and looked at his father as much as to say, "I wonder what the
    old man is up to now?"</p>

    <p>Locke was the first to recover his coolness. "Just what, Mr.
    Balcom, do you mean?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"I mean&mdash;" began Balcom, then stopped. "But first I
    will produce a witness who can vouch for all the facts which I
    am about to relate."</p>

    <p>Balcom went to the door and opened it. There, bobbing her
    head and smirking mechanically, stood that loathsome creature,
    Old Meg. In these rich surroundings her frightful squalor was
    all the more accentuated. Those at the table drew back in utter
    disgust as she tottered into the room. As she passed Zita she
    paused.</p>

    <p>"I held you in these arms when you were but a wee baby," she
    muttered, hideously.</p>

             </a>
         the hag aids balcom in his nefarious plans
    </div>

    <p>Zita drew away from her and looked at Balcom questioningly.
    Balcom now leaned far over the table and spoke
    impressively.</p>

    <p>"Twenty years ago Brent was secretly married to his
    secretary. There was a child. But Brent craved money, and power
    that the money would bring. Saddled with a wife and child, he
    was barred from his ambition, which was to marry some rich
    woman. So he made a hell on earth for his wife until, in
    desperation, she consented to an annulment of their
    marriage."</p>

    <p>The room was breathlessly quiet as Balcom continued.</p>

    <p>"Years passed and then his conscience smote him. He made his
    own child his secretary." Then he turned to Zita, pointing at
    her. "There she sits," he exclaimed, "and half of the voting
    power of this company belongs to her&mdash;Zita Brent, Zita
    Dane <i>Brent</i>."</p>

    <p>Instantly Locke was on his feet.</p>

    <p>"Balcom, you lie!" he rasped.</p>

    <p>"Lie or no lie," retorted Balcom, "as vice-president of the
    company I refuse to permit any action to be taken until Zita's
    position is legally established."</p>

    <p>Locke turned to Eva. "Miss Brent," he asked, with a bow,
    "may I speak for you?"</p>

    <p>Eva nodded.</p>

    <p>"Then, Balcom," remarked Locke, "we shall carry the proposed
    motion over your head. You cannot produce sufficient proofs to
    retard our action."</p>

    <p>"My protests," sneered Balcom, as he strode toward the door,
    "will be entered in the minutes of this meeting."</p>

    <p>Zita, in the excitement, had already disappeared. Paul bowed
    to Eva and Locke mockingly and followed his father.</p>

    <p>Old Meg squeezed herself against the walls of the library
    and was trying to get out of the room without being detected.
    But Locke was too alert for her and caught her by the shoulder,
    detaining her. She tried to fight him off with her feeble arms.
    Again and again he tried to question her.</p>

    <p>"The story is true, I tell you, gospel true," Meg repeated
    over and over again.</p>

    <p>Locke let her go and she started toward the door. Then the
    habit of a lifetime overcame her and she turned.</p>

    <p>"If you would know the truth, my pretty," she croaked at
    Eva, "come to Old Meg." Then she hobbled out.</p>

    <p>Eva was naturally perturbed, although Locke tried to comfort
    her. Yet she could not forget what had happened between him and
    Zita just before the meeting, and, woman-like, she now held
    aloof.</p>

    <p>"Eva," pleaded Locke, "won't you trust me? Things are in
    such a critical state that we must not have any
    misunderstanding."</p>

    <p>But Eva merely tossed her pretty head. "I don't care for
    Zita or her actions," she replied, petulantly.</p>

    <p>Locke diplomatically changed the subject. "I believe," he
    said, slowly, "that that old hag is in the pay of either Paul
    or his father, and I mean to find out which it is."</p>

    <p>Locke had started across the hallway when Eva called him
    back.</p>

    <p>"Quentin," she said, earnestly, "I trust
    you&mdash;absolutely." Then she hid her face in her hands and
    almost ran into the dining-room.</p>

    <p>Had she been a moment sooner she would have caught that
    mysterious person, Doctor Q, who had entered the house some
    time before, and, on overhearing heated words coming from the
    library, had remained with his ear glued to the keyhole,
    absorbing every word that was said until Balcom left. But he
    had shuffled away before she ran in.</p>

    <p>Back in Old Meg's den some time later the little gutter rat
    who, a few hours before, had brought the two thugs back to
    Balcom and Old Meg was coiled up in a corner, asleep.</p>

    <p>With light footsteps that did not awaken the sleeping boy, a
    strange little figure now came scurrying down the brick stairs.
    The figure hesitated a moment, then entered the foul den.</p>

    <p>In tatters, like the sleeping street gamin, this other boy
    still had something winsome, something elusively handsome,
    about him, a certain refinement of features. However, a black
    patch over one eye showed that this gamin was manly enough,
    evidently, when it came to fighting. He stirred the sleeping
    boy with his foot, and the boy, cursing volubly and beyond his
    years, roused himself.</p>

    <p>They talked excitedly in whispers and the boy who had just
    entered gave the street arab some money. Then together they
    tiptoed into the other room and down a flight of rickety steps
    into the cellar. This cellar connected with another cellar of
    large size that was used as a storehouse.</p>

    <p>The boys barely spoke and, when it was necessary, only in
    whispers. They came to a pile of cotton bales, found a
    convenient space between the bales, crawled in, and lay
    still.</p>

    <p>Night was coming fast as the hag, trailed by Locke, left
    Brent Rock. She walked fast for so old a woman, but, finally,
    coming to a street-car line, she took the first car that came
    along. Locke had had the foresight to have himself followed by
    one of the numerous Brent cars and so was able to keep the
    street-car in sight until the old woman alighted in her squalid
    quarter of town. Locke got out of his machine and followed her
    on foot, keeping close to the walls of the buildings to avoid
    having her see him.</p>

    <p>Old Meg turned the corner that ran alongside her dwelling,
    and there, for the first time, gave an indication that she was
    aware that she was being followed. She chuckled to herself,
    gave a few stumbling capers which might have been an imitation
    of a dance step, then waved her hand. Was it a signal?</p>

    <p>Locke was never to reach the alley. Old Meg had whipped
    around the corner so quickly that for a moment he was puzzled
    as to just where she had disappeared. He stopped with his back
    half turned to a flight of stairs leading down to the cellar
    entrance of a big warehouse. Suddenly he was sent stumbling
    forward to his knees, half dazed by a treacherous blow dealt
    from behind.</p>

    <p>He was up again in an instant and was defending himself from
    the attack of half a dozen thugs. He put up a splendid fight,
    but the odds were too great, and in a few minutes he was down
    on the ground, unconscious and bound.</p>

    <p>The emissaries of the Automaton, for such they were, carried
    him down the steps and into the warehouse cellar.</p>

    <p>Already, on leaving Brent Rock, Paul Balcom had not been
    idle. He had been immediately driven to a telegraph-office,
    where, after having used nearly an entire pad of blanks, he
    succeeded in composing the following message:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">Dearest Quentin</span>,&mdash;Have
        proofs that Old Meg spoke the truth. Meet me immediately at
        her place.</p>

        <p class="author">Zita.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The message was addressed to Locke at Brent Rock and was
    marked "Important."</p>

    <p>"That ought to fetch her!" muttered Paul, as he left the
    office.</p>

    <p>Twenty minutes or so later the telegram was delivered to the
    butler at Brent Rock, who brought it at once to Eva.</p>

    <p>At first she was loath to open a message addressed to some
    one else. But Quentin's affairs and her own were so intertwined
    by this time that she felt that the telegram would, in all
    probability, concern her as well as Locke. She tore it
    open.</p>

    <p>"Dearest Quentin," she read and for a minute could get no
    farther, for it seemed as if a mist had formed before her eyes.
    She clutched at the balustrade. Then pride, jealousy, and a
    certain anger surged up within her and she finished reading the
    telegram.</p>

    <p>Eva was in a quandary what to do. She paced up and down the
    hallway, biting her lips and repressing the tears.</p>

    <p>Could it be possible, after all, that Locke was faithless?
    Was this the man who had been so kind, who had saved her from a
    thousand dangers? At any rate, she would find out once and for
    all.</p>

    <p>Faint and heart-sick, she gave orders to have her runabout
    brought around. It was a long drive from Brent Rock, but Eva's
    fast speedster covered the ground quickly. Twice policemen
    tried to stop her and, failing, probably took the number of her
    car. Nothing could deter her. And, as the cool evening wind
    lashed her face, faith in Locke revived and the suspicion came
    that she might be rushing into danger. But no thought of
    herself entered her mind as she stepped on the accelerator and
    the car shot forward. Her single thought was of speed, more
    speed, to get to Locke quickly.</p>

    <p>She was appalled at the squalor of the neighborhood in which
    she finally found herself. Disgusted and revolted at the filth
    of Old Meg's abode, still not for an instant did she falter or
    hesitate. She ran down the steps to Old Meg's home.</p>

    <p>The old hag was evidently awaiting her, for this time she
    did not hide at the sound of approaching footsteps, but came
    forward, courtesying and mumbling greetings, while her eyes
    gleamed with a satisfaction that was positively hellish.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Locke&mdash;where is he?" Eva gasped.</p>

    <p>"All in good time, my pretty, all in good time," mumbled the
    hag. "You're to wait for him here."</p>

    <p>But Eva insisted on seeing Locke at once and the old hag
    lied volubly. He had been here, and had stepped out for a
    moment. No, she did not know where&mdash;to get a cigar, maybe.
    Would the pretty lady hear her fortune told while she
    waited?</p>

    <p>As there was apparently nothing that she could do until
    Locke returned, Eva sat at the card-table while Old Meg droned
    her old fortune-telling rigamarole.</p>

    <p>In spite of her growing fear and agitation Eva became
    interested. There was something calming in the monotonous voice
    of the old crone.</p>

    <p>"When the queen of spades comes between the jack of hearts
    and the king of diamonds and the&mdash;a&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

    <p>A door directly behind Eva silently and slowly opened.
    Stealthily a boy's head was thrust out. On the young face was a
    world of deadly hatred. As the sputtering candle burned
    brighter for a moment, startlingly, a vague change was
    noticeable in the lineaments of the features.</p>

    <p>It was the same gamin who had given the sleeping boy money.
    But now, in the candle-light, with only the head showing, it
    was no boy who glared malevolently at Eva, but a
    woman&mdash;and that woman was the implacable Zita!</p>

    <p>The head disappeared to give place to the visages of two
    horrible-looking men, the same brutes who were present when
    Balcom had spread the net of his conspiracy.</p>

    <p>"When the jack of clubs," droned the witch, "and
    the&mdash;"</p>

    <p>With barely a sound the two thugs entered the room behind
    Eva. In the hand of one was an old gunny sack.</p>

    <p>"&mdash;and the queen of hearts&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Eva was so interested now that she leaned far over the
    table, her eyes fastened on the cards as they fell.</p>

    <p>A thug stumbled. Eva, startled, sat back quickly and tried
    to rise. But the next instant she felt herself struggling in
    the heavy folds of the grimy gunny sack.</p>

    <p>The emissaries, carrying Locke, had staggered with their
    burden into the warehouse cellar until, coming to a closed
    door, one of them rapped on it in a peculiar manner that was
    evidently a signal. An instant, and the door opened.</p>

    <p>Through it stalked the Automaton.</p>

    <p>The monster gazed intently at Locke as though to determine
    whether it were indeed he, then waved the emissaries on to the
    shaft of a huge freight elevator.</p>

    <p>In the shaft, directly under the elevator platform, they now
    cast Locke's unconscious body.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure the watchman's still up above?" asked one.</p>

    <p>"Sure."</p>

    <p>"Then give a ring for the basement."</p>

    <p>A thug pressed the button that signaled. In a moment,
    creaking and groaning, the massive elevator started to
    descend.</p>

    <p>A shuffling of feet was heard and down the stairs leading
    from Old Meg's quarters came the two thugs carrying Eva. A few
    feet behind them, still in boy's clothes, was Zita.</p>

    <p>The jar to his body as the emissaries threw him on the
    concrete floor had tended to bring Locke back to consciousness.
    For a moment he lay still. Then the sound of the descending
    elevator attracted his attention. He gazed upward and dimly saw
    the slowly moving platform. In a flash he realized his
    danger.</p>

    <p>Locke struggled fiercely to dislodge his bonds. He contorted
    his body, expanded his powerful chest in an effort to break the
    ropes that held him a prisoner.</p>

    <p>At this moment the thugs that were carrying Eva passed by,
    followed by others. Apparently they took no notice of him, but
    continued on their way with the helpless girl.</p>

    <p>Locke, his own danger forgotten, became frantic with
    apprehension for her and tore savagely at the restraining
    ropes.</p>

    <p>Zita stopped. Her face was a study of conflicting emotions
    as she saw Locke struggling at the bottom of the shaft.</p>

    <p>Floor by floor, inch by inch, the enormous elevator, that
    would crush out Locke's life as though he were an insect,
    continued to descend.</p>

    <p>Zita stepped to an electric switch. That switch would stop
    the elevator immediately and save Locke's life.</p>

    <p>She raised her hand&mdash;and then, looking after the
    retreating thugs and emissaries, she saw Eva again. Zita's lips
    formed a cruel line and a flinty hardness came into her
    eyes.</p>

    <p>Her hand dropped.</p>

    <p>There were only a few feet between Locke and the descending
    elevator. Locke was struggling frenziedly to escape and rescue
    Eva.</p>

    <p>Zita's hand went out again and grasped the handle of the
    switch.</p>

    <p>She hesitated, hate on her face.</p>

    <p>Would she, for love of Locke, who had not returned her love,
    save him?</p>

    <p>Could she bring herself to save this man&mdash;for a woman
    she hated, who had won him from her?</p>

    <p>If she saved him it would be only to lose him to the other
    woman.</p>

    <p>With a great creaking the massive elevator was within only a
    few short inches of Locke.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

    <p>Every fiber of Zita's body was galvanized into action as she
    threw the whole weight of her body against the elevator
    emergency-control switch.</p>

    <p>There was a sputtering of blue flame as the connection was
    made, and Zita closed her eyes. With a shudder she heard the
    great elevator strike the cellar floor and then rebound.</p>

    <p>She dared not open her eyes. The last thing that she had
    seen was Locke struggling frantically to escape from under the
    elevator that was only a few inches above him and seemed
    destined to crush out his life.</p>

    <p>Slowly, fearfully, she opened her eyes. Locke's body lay
    motionless at her feet, separated almost literally by only the
    breadth of a hair from the shaft.</p>

    <p>The relief, the reaction from her terrible emotions, made
    Zita half hysterical. Trembling in every limb, she made her way
    to Locke and fell on her knees by him. She wrapped her arms
    about him and held his head up.</p>

    <p>It was thus that she was holding him when his eyes slowly
    opened and gazed questioningly into her own, his brow knitted
    in perplexity.</p>

    <p>Then, with a rush, it all came back to him&mdash;the
    descending elevator, Zita standing at the switch, while his
    life hung in the balance, his last frantic effort to escape
    just before the descending elevator had grazed his head,
    rendering him unconscious. That Zita, at the last moment, had
    attempted to save his life he did not know, nor why she now
    gazed at him frankly with eyes of love.</p>

    <p>It was all inexplicable to him.</p>

    <p>Another instant and he had wrenched himself loose from
    Zita's arms and was struggling with the ropes that still bound
    him even after he had managed to roll out from under the
    elevator in the last nick of time.</p>

    <p>He had suddenly realized that the sight of Eva being carried
    off by the emissaries had not been a hideous dream, but a
    terrible actuality, and that at this very moment she was
    probably in the most imminent danger.</p>

    <p>Zita realized that he wanted freedom to rush to Eva's
    assistance. Had she dared, she would have refused to release
    him from her arms, would at least have hindered his untying his
    bonds. But there was a masterful something about his silent
    demand to be released that would admit of no refusal.</p>

    <p>In a few seconds Locke completed the freeing of himself and
    was dashing madly toward the door through which the gang,
    carrying Eva, had passed.</p>

    <p>The door was unlocked, and, hesitating not an instant,
    Quentin dashed through and into a large room.</p>

    <p>Eva, the gunny sack removed and still unconscious, lay on
    the floor. The emissaries were grouped around her. In the
    background, dimly visible, stood the iron monster.</p>

    <p>Startled, they looked up as Locke rushed into the room. But
    before they could do more, Locke had whipped out his automatic
    and, point-blank, was blazing away at the murderous crew. Two
    emissaries fell dead or mortally wounded. The others
    scattered.</p>

    <p>Only the Automaton, man of iron that he was, showed no sign
    of fear. Instead, he advanced ponderously upon Locke.</p>

    <p>The automatic barked again, but did not succeed in deterring
    the monster. Locke realized the futility of using this puny
    weapon against such a foe.</p>

    <p>He dashed toward Eva. It was the work of only an instant to
    snatch her up, practically from under the monster's feet, to
    turn, and to carry her through the door by which he had been
    brought in. Holding her in one arm, he slammed the door shut
    and shot the bolt.</p>

    <p>He was just in time, for the next instant the door bulged
    out beneath the dead weight of the Automaton as it hurled its
    massive form against the other side.</p>

    <p>Zita vas still waiting at the elevator shaft when Locke,
    carrying Eva in his arms, entered. At the sight Zita's whole
    body expressed her unquenched hatred of the unconscious girl.
    Her eyes narrowed, her lips became livid, and her hands
    clenched as though she would like to strike the helpless
    Eva.</p>

    <p>"Zita," demanded Locke, suspiciously, "why did you hesitate
    to save my life?"</p>

    <p>"Because," she replied&mdash;and her voice indicated the
    force of her answer whether it were really the truth or
    not&mdash;"I love you, and would not save you&mdash;for
    <i>her</i>"</p>

    <p>Zita turned and ran up the stairs leading to Old Meg's as
    Locke turned to try to revive Eva.</p>

    <p>But the hammer blows of the monster resounded throughout the
    cellar. At any moment the door might come crashing down and
    Locke and Eva might again be at the mercy of the iron
    fiend.</p>

    <p>Locke caught up Eva in his arms again and, groping, sought
    the exit of the warehouse.</p>

    <p>He dared not follow Zita through Old Meg's den. Love that
    could for any reason hesitate or injure the one loved was
    incomprehensible to him. He felt that the hag's den might now
    be but an ambush and that Zita might have run ahead to warn the
    uninjured emissaries of his coming.</p>

    <p>By a lucky chance he found the path leading directly to the
    warehouse steps and the street. Eva's speedster had not been
    moved or tampered with and he placed Eva gently in the seat,
    climbed in, and started the motor. As he did so three
    emissaries came running out of the alley leading to Old Meg's.
    But shooting the gears into high speed, Locke easily evaded
    them and turned up the first corner.</p>

    <p>He was going to take Eva to the first doctor's or a
    drug-store, but it proved not to be necessary. The rush of the
    air as the car moved rapidly revived her, and in a few moments
    she was quite herself again, eagerly questioning him about her
    rescue.</p>

    <p>Although they were thankful for their escape, still they
    could not blind themselves to the fact that all their efforts
    had been in vain, that they stood no nearer to their great
    desire, and that, at least until now, their enemies had proved
    too wily and too strong for them.</p>

    <p>But they were young, courageous, and resourceful, and as
    they drew up before Brent Rock they were busily engaged with
    plans for the future.</p>

    <p>It was the following afternoon in the Chinese quarter. The
    Celestials were celebrating one of their numerous feasts. Long
    multicolored banners and streamers were hanging from every
    window and balcony and were even strung across the narrow
    street, almost brushing the faces of the motley throng that
    passed beneath. Tom-toms and cymbals beat and clashed, while
    from the Chinese theater came the shrill piping of reeds and
    the high-pitched chanting voices of Chinamen.</p>

    <p>Street venders cried their wares and the windows of the
    Oriental shops were gaily bedecked for the holiday.</p>

    <p>Through the dense happy throng a man made his way. He, too,
    was an Oriental, but of a different race. A giant in size, he
    calmly pushed and shoved the smaller Celestials out of his
    path, and, although they chattered angrily at him, their
    resentment went no farther, for his size and the menace of his
    swarthy face made them pause.</p>

    <p>Before the entrance of a curio-shop he halted and consulted
    a card. Then, satisfied that he had found his destination, he
    picked up a wicker carrying-case that for the moment he had
    placed on the curb and entered the shop.</p>

    <p>A Chinaman stepped forward, scrutinized him closely, and,
    nodding significantly, bade the new-comer follow him.</p>

    <p>They went to the back of the shop. The Chinese clapped his
    hands, and a panel in the wall slid back, disclosing a
    stairway. The new-comer stepped through the aperture and the
    panel closed behind him. He mounted the stairs and came to a
    room, magnificent in its Oriental splendor.</p>

    <p>Priceless rugs covered the floor and walls, while on
    wonderfully carved teakwood stands reposed ancient porcelains,
    specimens of bygone dynasties, antique arms and armor cunningly
    wrought, jades and ivories marvelously fashioned by master
    craftsmen long since dead. Seen through the filmy haze of
    rising incense, the room was a veritable treasure-house of
    Oriental art.</p>

    <p>On low settees a few richly clad Chinese were reclining, and
    in a far corner, gazing intently into a globe of crystal, sat a
    man of the same race as the new-comer, a Madagascan.</p>

    <p>Startled at the entrance of the giant, he left off his
    shadow-gazing and came hastily forward, cringing as he did
    so.</p>

    <p>The giant, in an impressive, booming voice, now spoke for
    the first time.</p>

    <p>"I, the Strangler, have come from Madagascar with the Great
    Torture."</p>

    <p>A door opened and Doctor Q entered the room, his head
    wagging from side to side.</p>

    <p>As he caught sight of the Madagascan he stopped short and
    put his hand to his head with a gesture of perplexity, striving
    piteously to place the stranger. He could not succeed. With a
    half-running, half-stumbling gait he withdrew to a corner of
    the room and furtively watched the two Madagascans.</p>

    <p>There came the sound of a gong. A panel slid back, and into
    the room there majestically swept a Chinaman of pure Mongolian
    type.</p>

    <p>He was gorgeously clad in flowing silks and wore the
    princely cap with a button. At a glance his piercing eye took
    in every detail of the room. Then he went directly to the
    Madagascan, whose overbearing air of assurance immediately
    forsook him at the Chinaman's approach.</p>

    <p>He bowed low and reverently, for it was Long Fang to whom he
    made obeisance, Long Fang, leader of a great Tong, and
    implacable foe to all others, a Chinese whose tentacles of
    power reached into every corner of the underworld, spreading
    terror.</p>

    <p>In an incisive, icy voice that sent a chill through the big
    man's frame, he now spoke.</p>

    <p>"You have been overlong on your journey and we have been
    waiting for you." Then with a menace in his voice he snarled,
    "It is well for you that you came at last."</p>

    <p>The big man shuddered and remained silent. Long Fang crossed
    to Doctor Q.</p>

    <p>"The instrument of torture is here," he said. "The
    Madagascan has just brought it. He is an unrivaled
    strangler."</p>

    <p>"Let him approach," commanded Doctor Q.</p>

    <p>Long Fang beckoned, and the Strangler came forward. His eyes
    had been fixed on the Chinese, but now they roved to the figure
    of Doctor Q, and he fell back in consternation, clutching the
    other Madagascan by the shoulder and gasping in awestruck
    tones.</p>

    <p>"In our country his magic is supreme!"</p>

    <p>With difficulty he controlled himself and bowed low, his
    forehead almost touching the floor. Then he looked away,
    cringing.</p>

    <p>"I see that you recognize me," Doctor Q chuckled,
    fiendishly. "Good! You will not be so foolish as to fail
    me."</p>

    <p>"No, no, master, I swear it by&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Never mind your oath. My power is my guaranty.
    Go&mdash;follow Long Fang. He will direct you to the
    torture-chamber."</p>

    <p>Doctor Q turned on his heel and hobbled out of the room.</p>

    <p>Long Fang and the Strangler were about to proceed to the
    torture-chamber when footsteps were heard on the stairway that
    led to the curio-shop below. Long Fang and the Madagascan
    stopped and listened.</p>

    <p>Another moment and De Luxe Dora and Paul Balcom stepped into
    the room. With a curt command Paul called Long Fang to him and
    the Chinaman, important as he was, hastened to obey.</p>

    <p>What was this strange power that Paul, at will, could
    exercise throughout the underworld?</p>

    <p>With a few terse questions Paul ascertained the exact
    condition of affairs.</p>

    <p>"You say, Long Fang, that all is ready?"</p>

    <p>"All, master. We only awaited your coming."</p>

    <p>Then with a graceful gesture he asked, "Will you so far
    honor your humble servant?" as he indicated the way into
    another room.</p>

    <p>Dora, followed by Paul and the Chinese, stepped through the
    portal and came to a Chinese temple.</p>

    <p>It was a large room and the decorations, although equally
    well executed as those in the room they had just left, were
    actually terrifying. Flying dragons and serpents done in bronze
    hung from the ceiling, while on a raised dais at the farther
    end of the room was an enormous squatting figure of the
    seven-handed god. Before it, in braziers, fire gleamed, giving
    off a heavy, pungent odor that was almost overpowering to
    Occidental nostrils.</p>

    <p>On either side of the huge image hung silken curtains, in
    all probability covering doorways into yet other chambers.</p>

    <p>For the first time Dora showed signs of interest. With the
    shop and the first chamber she was already familiar, but this
    was something new, something to give the spur to her satiated,
    <i>blasé</i> nature. She moved about the place, fingering the
    rare tapestries, contemplating probably what gorgeous hangings
    they would make for her own apartment.</p>

    <p>Dora's preoccupation gave Long Fang his opportunity to
    confer with Paul alone and he moved closer to him.</p>

    <p>"Master," he nodded, "why not use the beautiful lady to lure
    the other one into our power?"</p>

    <p>Paul shook his head negatively. He knew that Eva was aware
    that Dora was her enemy.</p>

    <p>"But, master," persisted the Chinese, "you told me that this
    Miss Brent loves her father, and that she would do anything for
    his recovery. Let this lady tell her that the Madagascan has
    brought an antidote that will restore his reason. She will come
    here and we shall trap her."</p>

    <p>For a moment Paul stood in deep thought, then called to
    Dora.</p>

    <p>At first she laughed at the idea that Eva would even listen
    to her. But Dora was clever and conceited and in the end she
    agreed that at least she would make the attempt.</p>

    <p>At this moment in another quarter of town Paul's father was
    ready to leave his apartment, yet from his nervousness it could
    readily be seen that he was waiting for some one. A Madagascan
    servant entered and salaamed.</p>

    <p>"Master," he announced, "the Strangler has arrived from
    Madagascar."</p>

    <p>Balcom's face lighted up with intense satisfaction and
    cunning at the news. He waved the servant away, picked up his
    hat and stick, and hurried out.</p>

    <p>In the library at Brent Rock Eva and Locke were having an
    earnest conversation. Locke had on his motoring togs and was on
    the point of going out.</p>

    <p>"By elimination," he was saying, "I will prove that either
    Paul or his father is the Automaton. I am going to trap
    Paul."</p>

    <p>"Quentin," cautioned Eva, "for my sake be careful."</p>

    <p>Locke strove to quiet her fears, pointing out that his
    scheme was necessary in order to save her father, and in the
    end Eva reluctantly consented.</p>

    <p>She went with him to the porte-cochère where his car was
    already waiting.</p>

    <p>"Good luck!" she tried to call cheerfully, in spite of her
    misgivings.</p>

    <p>Long after his car had disappeared in the distance she stood
    there gazing after it, a world of anxiety in her eyes.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

    <p>Darkness had settled down upon Brent Rock, following the
    departure of Locke, when a trim runabout drew up under the
    porte-cochère and Dora stepped lightly out of it.</p>

    <p>She paused for a moment and looked about curiously. For some
    time she hesitated. In this house lived the girl whom in her
    heart Dora hated bitterly.</p>

    <p>What sort of reception might she expect? Yet Paul and his
    underworldlings had played on Dora's pride until they had
    prevailed on her to undertake the mission. As she looked about
    all her old assurance came back to her and Dora turned and
    approached the door boldly.</p>

    <p>Eva was just about to go up-stairs to her room when she
    heard the butler at the door and a woman's voice asking whether
    Miss Brent was at home. Eva paused a moment.</p>

    <p>There was evidently a slight altercation between the butler
    and the new-comer as the latter raised her voice sharply.</p>

    <p>"You will tell Miss Brent I must see her," reiterated
    Dora.</p>

    <p>There was a pause, during which the butler was heard to
    murmur something, and then the woman's voice was heard
    again.</p>

    <p>"Tell Miss Brent that if she refuses to see me she will
    regret it all her life."</p>

    <p>Eva was intensely interested now, for she recognized the
    voice of De Luxe Dora. But with her interest there came a
    feeling of repulsion with which this woman always inspired her,
    and her first impulse was to have Dora shown out of the
    house.</p>

    <p>The very nature of the danger with which they were all
    surrounded, however, prohibited such a drastic course. Yet how
    dare that woman enter Brent Rock?</p>

    <p>Still, the very fact of her so daring pointed to some
    serious matter which Eva felt she ought to know. At any rate,
    there could be no harm to listen to Dora's reason for coming,
    and there would probably be much to be learned.</p>

    <p>Eva called to the butler and he stepped aside, and Dora, all
    smiles now, and with her hand extended in greeting, advanced
    toward Eva, who ignored her extended hand.</p>

    <p>"Need I tell you," remarked Eva, coldly, "that I am
    astounded at your presumption in coming here?"</p>

    <p>"Miss Brent," replied Dora, "believe me, nothing but my
    present mission could have induced me to do so. There are
    wheels within wheels which have made it appear that I am your
    enemy. But that is far from being the truth, as my present
    mission to you will prove."</p>

    <p>Dora was clever and played her cards cleverly. However, Eva
    was on guard.</p>

    <p>"Please come to the point," she insisted. "Tell me exactly
    why you have come."</p>

    <p>Dora paused a moment, then replied, impressively, "I have
    come to save your father's life."</p>

    <p>Eva caught herself almost gasping in astonishment as Dora
    covertly watched the effect of her words. "You have the
    antidote, then?" asked Eva, breathlessly.</p>

    <p>"Not exactly that," replied Dora, quickly. "But I can take
    you where you can obtain it. A man has arrived from Madagascar
    who has it in his possession."</p>

    <p>"What shall I do?" almost wailed the poor girl. "How can I
    know that you speak the truth?"</p>

    <p>Dora's voice now assumed a cold decisiveness. "That is for
    you to decide," she said merely. "Refuse to come with me and
    your father will surely die of his madness. Consent&mdash;and
    he may live."</p>

    <p>Eva could hesitate no longer. Bidding Dora wait, she ran up
    the stairs, returning in a few moments garbed for the
    street.</p>

    <p>They left the house together, but not before the butler had
    surreptitiously slipped a large automatic into Eva's
    hand-bag.</p>

    <p>In the Chinese temple, or Joss-house, the last devotee had
    departed. The hanging lights had been dimmed and now the
    fantastic shapes with which the place was decorated, seen in
    the subdued light, stood out in all their shadowy
    weirdness.</p>

    <p>From the raised dais, the seven-handed god assumed an added
    majesty and awfulness, while, deep-seated as though from a
    smoldering caldron, two points of fire gleamed from the god's
    eyes with utmost malevolence.</p>

    <p>Slowly a panel in the wall slid back and the bestial visage
    of the Strangler peered out.</p>

    <p>After making sure that there was no one about, with
    noiseless tread he glided into the temple.</p>

    <p>Like a shadow, a second figure, that of a Chinaman, followed
    him. The two made a complete circuit of the temple, stopping
    now and again to examine some object which arrested their
    attention. Then, as if by a prearranged signal, they both
    prostrated themselves before the fire god.</p>

    <p>After making many obeisances they got to their feet and, as
    mysteriously as they entered, slipped away in the same manner
    that they had come. A panel closed behind them, but not the
    same panel.</p>

    <p>The inner room in which they now found themselves was
    divided by a partition that extended a few feet out into the
    temple room itself.</p>

    <p>This room was vividly painted with weird figures depicting
    Chinese forms of torture, a veritable charnel-house of what in
    Europe would be called the Dark Ages. There were plenty of
    evidences that at no very distant date this chamber had been in
    use to punish horribly those who had offended against the fire
    god or the commands of the Tong leaders.</p>

    <p>On one side of the partition was a large iron wheel to which
    was attached a rope extending through the partition and forming
    a loop or noose on the other side. The purpose of this device
    was only too apparent. Once the neck of a victim was in the
    noose, a few turns of the wheel, the noose would tighten, and
    the victim would be inevitably strangled to death. In a
    slightly changed form it was the garroting-machine of old
    Spain.</p>

    <p>The Strangler tested the rope, twisted the wheel, while his
    companion occupied himself by watching the effect of the wheel
    on the noose on the other side of the partition.</p>

    <p>Apparently satisfied that the machine was in good working
    order, the Madagascan straightened up and waved his companion
    out of the room.</p>

    <p>The Chinaman returned by means of the sliding panel into the
    temple again.</p>

    <p>As she left Brent Rock behind, Eva's fears increased.
    Speeding through the night with this woman whom she
    instinctively dreaded, whom she had every reason to distrust,
    many times on the trip Eva wished herself back at her home.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, to remain inactive while there was a
    chance to save her father's life was unthinkable. And so, for
    his sake, she kept on and the car sped ahead.</p>

    <p>Dora, on the contrary, anxious to allay Eva's fears, was
    very voluble, expressing many sentiments which even to a young
    girl of little worldly experience were palpably at variance
    with the woman's character.</p>

    <p>In and out of the narrow streets of the city's lower quarter
    the car twisted and turned, and at last entered gaily decked
    Chinatown, where it came to a halt.</p>

    <p>If Eva was afraid before she was now doubly so. The strange
    Oriental faces which seemed to leer at her from street and curb
    seemed to be almost of another world, and she thought of the
    many tales she had heard, of their treachery and cunning.</p>

    <p>Dora, sensing what was passing through her mind, kept up a
    patter of small talk as she urged Eva forward.</p>

    <p>By another entrance than the one that led through the
    Chinese curio-shop they entered the Joss-house and came to the
    worshiping-room of the temple.</p>

    <p>Eva gazed fearfully about her now at all the fantastic
    decorations with which she was surrounded. Her only comfort was
    the handle of the automatic that the butler had pressed on her
    as she was leaving home.</p>

    <p>"This Madagascan with the antidote," asked Eva, tremulously,
    "where is he?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, dearie," quieted Dora. "Wait a moment here and
    I will bring him."</p>

    <p>Dora turned on her heel and left the temple by the door
    leading into the beautiful lounging-room beyond.</p>

    <p>Eva stood transfixed by the solemn awfulness of the place
    and the grim visage of the fire god. Why had she been brought
    to such a place? What new terrors awaited her here?</p>

    <p>She seemed alone&mdash;yet was she?</p>

    <p>She felt a thousand eyes regarding her, as though a thousand
    dangers lurked to destroy her just beyond those fearful
    walls.</p>

    <p>She was staring now at the god. What made his eyes gleam so
    banefully?</p>

    <p>She thought she heard a sound!</p>

    <p>Was the wall at the right of the statue moving? Or was it
    merely her heightened imagination?</p>

    <p>Fascinated, she watched.</p>

    <p>Yes, she was sure now. Slowly, slowly a portion of that wall
    was actually sliding back.</p>

    <p>Now she saw a hand. Then an arm followed. With a slow,
    gliding movement that even to Eva's strained ears was
    noiseless, a man, his back toward her, slid into the room.</p>

    <p>Eva, shrinking back, wanted to shriek. But instead she
    whipped out the automatic and in an instant had the man
    covered.</p>

    <p>The man was still evidently unconscious of her presence. But
    suddenly he must have heard Eva move. For he wheeled around,
    and instinctively his hands went above his head.</p>

    <p>As for Eva, the cry that she had suppressed at his
    appearance was suppressed no longer, for the man whom she held
    at her mercy was&mdash;Locke!</p>

    <p>"How did you come here?" gasped Eva.</p>

    <p>Hurriedly he told her his story&mdash;how he felt that the
    clue that would lead to the unraveling of this mystery was now
    to be found in Chinatown, how he had made his way, therefore,
    to the Chinese quarter, how he had tracked the Madagascan.</p>

    <p>Knowing the futility of trying to enter any private place of
    the Orientals, much less their temple, in Occidental garb, he
    had waylaid a Chinaman in an alley, had stripped him, and had
    changed clothes with him.</p>

    <p>Disguised thus, Locke had managed to enter, to observe, and
    was only now on his way to summon assistance. For he had
    decided to have the place raided. Only now he was stricken
    almost dumb with astonishment at being confronted by Eva.</p>

    <p>There was no time for more. Before Eva could explain her own
    presence there the door burst open, the panels slid back, and a
    horde of emissaries and Chinamen swarmed about them.</p>

    <p>Eva fired her automatic again and again, but could not stay
    the rush.</p>

    <p>Locke fought with the courage of despair. But they were too
    many and soon bore him down.</p>

    <p>As they carried Locke into the chamber of torture the last
    thing he saw was Eva surrounded by her foes, who were closing
    in on the poor girl.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Towering above them all, he saw the gigantic form of the
    Automaton.</p>

    <p>In the torture-chamber Locke was shackled hand and foot to
    the partition, while the noose of the garroting-machine was
    placed about his neck.</p>

    <p>The Madagascan supervised this work, then waved the
    emissaries out of the room. They were alone there now, these
    two&mdash;the professional murderer and his victim.</p>

    <p>With a sneer the Madagascan turned and went to the other
    side of the partition where the wheel was by which the noose
    was tightened, strangling the victim.</p>

    </div>

    <p>But the Strangler little knew with whom he had to deal, for
    already Locke was struggling at his shackles.</p>

    <p>With almost incredible dexterity Locke succeeded in
    loosening them, one after the other, so that, as the Madagascan
    started to turn the wheel, Locke, with a marvelous effort,
    bracing his feet against the wall and grasping the staples to
    which the shackles had been attached, managed to pin-wheel his
    body around and around, as the Strangler turned the iron wheel
    that tightened the noose which was to stifle out his life.</p>

    <p>Fortunately the Madagascan turned slowly, so that Locke
    managed to turn his body faster than the wheel was being
    turned, thus gaining on the noose and at each revolution
    loosening it a trifle.</p>

    <p>Another quick turn of his body, the pressure against his
    neck had become less!</p>

    <p>Yet another complete circle, and, tearing at the noose, he
    managed to get his head free.</p>

    <p>It was the work of only an instant to dash around the
    partition and beat the Strangler to the floor. Another instant,
    and he had torn back the panel into the temple.</p>

    <p>The sight that confronted him was sickening.</p>

    <p>Two fiends were holding Eva close to the floor, while now
    from the fire god's eyes a blinding glare of flame blazed
    forth, the two rays converging and scorching the very ground as
    they traveled slowly nearer and nearer, in their fatal focus,
    to the helpless girl.</p>

    <p>With a wild shout, Locke charged on them all.</p>

    <p>Taken by surprise, the brutes holding Eva were easy to
    handle, for the others had gone.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the automatic which Eva had been carrying was
    lying, neglected, on the floor. Locke snatched it up and,
    shooting one of the thugs, managed to cower the other.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

        the escape from the garotte
    </div>

    <p>Half supporting Eva, he retreated through the
    torture-chamber into an outer room. There was no time to lose.
    Already the alarm had been spread to the other emissaries and
    Chinamen, and it was only a matter of seconds when all the
    murderous crew would again be piling after them.</p>

    <p>Locke looked about in desperation. There was a window. He
    flung it open. Below, the air-shaft or court was blind. But
    there was a balcony by which he could reach an adjoining low
    roof. He had no idea where it might lead, but any unknown
    danger was preferable to the known dangers that threatened
    behind him.</p>

    <p>Through the window he passed with Eva, and so across
    balconies and roofs until they came to a fire-escape, which
    they descended.</p>

    <p>In another moment they were free of Chinatown.</p>

    <p>Many a curious glance was cast at them, a young girl, well
    gowned, and a disheveled white man in Chinese garb.</p>

    <p>Locke hailed a night-hawk cabman and they were soon speeding
    on their way back to safety and Brent Rock.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

    <p>At the cove fishing-village, set on the extreme outskirts of
    the town, there stood an old fisherman's shack that was shunned
    by all the good folk of the city.</p>

    <p>While there was nothing definite that could be said of the
    evil deeds of the inhabitants, there was much shaking of heads
    and wagging of tongues to the effect that all was not as it
    should be at the cove.</p>

    <p>The owner of the old shack, Old Tom, was an ill-favored,
    taciturn man who would have naught to do with any of his
    neighbors, and asked only that they keep out of his path and
    leave him alone. He even evinced an aversion to dogs and to
    little children, driving them away from his shack whenever he
    found them near it.</p>

    <p>The threat that "Old Tom will catch you" would make a cove
    fishing-village tractable at any time.</p>

    <p>Old Tom rarely put to sea, and when he did it was more often
    than not after nightfall, a time when the good folk of the
    village were preparing for a night's rest.</p>

    <p>It was stated by one old crony that often at night other men
    came to Old Tom's shack, that they entered slyly, and that well
    into the morning revelry, and often oaths and brawls, could be
    heard from within.</p>

    <p>Some hinted that Old Tom was a smuggler; others, even, that
    he was a wrecker. True it was that often strange lights were
    seen to flicker outside the bar to the cove.</p>

    <p>Also there had been wrecks, and often, in the morning, when
    the fishermen put out to a wreck, after a storm, it would be
    discovered that some one had been there before them, since
    valuable and readily portable parts of the wreck were
    frequently missing.</p>

    <p>But while suspicion pointed to Old Tom and the strange men
    that frequented his place, proofs positive of a crime were
    invariably lacking, and so the village tolerated Old Tom's
    presence and predicted his bad end.</p>

    <p>It was to this shack that there came very early one morning,
    before the break of day, a wounded man assisted by a woman. The
    woman gave a peculiar rap at the door. There was a quick scurry
    inside, as of fast-moving feet, then silence.</p>

    <p>The woman rapped again, and this time with more force. After
    a moment a sash was raised and a querulous voice demanded what
    was wanted.</p>

    <p>"It's De Luxe Dora and Paul Balcom, and he's wounded. Quick,
    open the door!"</p>

    <p>There was a rush to open the door now and rough hands gently
    assisted the wounded man to a seat inside.</p>

    <p>While Paul was not perhaps so dangerously wounded, yet it
    was easy to be seen that the wound was not to be trifled with,
    for the cut had been severe and the blood flowed copiously.</p>

    <p>Dora, whatever her attitude toward others, had a true
    solicitude for Paul, and all the womanliness of her nature came
    to the surface as she tenderly bathed Paul's head and attempted
    to bind the wound with the rough bandages at hand.</p>

    <p>There were several tough-looking men standing about, and
    from their ready sympathy, real or feigned, it was easy to be
    seen that these men, too, like the others of the underworld,
    stood ready to do Paul's slightest bidding, to guard him with
    their lives if need be.</p>

    <p>What was this strange power that this man, scarcely more
    than a youth, wielded over these outlawed men?</p>

    <p>"Quick!" exclaimed Dora. "Watch the window. We've probably
    been followed."</p>

    <p>A grim-visaged man moved lumberingly over to the window and
    glued his head against the pane, straining his eyes as he
    peered out.</p>

    <p>For a long time he did not move, while, with the others
    grouped around, Dora tried to stanch the flow of blood from
    Paul's injured head.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the watcher at the window turned and shouted, "Man
    comin' up the lane!"</p>

    <p>Instantly there was confusion within the shack. The men
    scattered in all directions, while one old hag, the only woman
    in the shack besides Dora, hobbled over to a stool and took up
    the mending of a huge net where she had left off.</p>

    <p>Old Tom ambled over to Dora and for a moment they talked
    hurriedly. Finally Dora came to a decision, as she pointed to
    the old rickety stairway to an attic above.</p>

    <p>"Carry him to the attic," she directed. "He can be well
    hidden there. As for the rest of you, remember, no one has come
    here to-night."</p>

    <p>Two of the men lifted Paul, who, while not in an absolutely
    unconscious condition, was much too weak by this time from loss
    of blood to assist himself.</p>

    <p>They carried him up the stairs and into an old, disused room
    to which Dora followed, and when the two men had descended the
    stairs she remained, alternately ministering to Paul and
    listening for what might happen below.</p>

    <p>Paul and Dora had left the main room of the shack not a
    moment too soon. For barely had the two men who had carried
    Paul to the attic returned when a face was momentarily seen
    outside, while a pair of eyes peered into the room.</p>

    <p>A moment later there was a peremptory knock at the door.</p>

    <p>"Come in!" growled Old Tom.</p>

    <p>With eyes that scanned every cranny and nook and searched
    every face, Locke stepped into the shack.</p>

    <p>The men came forward a step, then halted. There was
    something in Locke's face that showed that he was in deadly
    earnest and not to be trifled with.</p>

    <p>Locke looked from one to the other, then turned to Old Tom.
    "The wounded man who was brought here," he demanded, "where is
    he?"</p>

    <p>"There 'ain't been no wounded man brought here," retorted
    Old Tom.</p>

    <p>The men crowded a little closer, all denying vehemently that
    any one had entered.</p>

    <p>At this instant a drop of blood fell on Locke's sleeve from
    the ceiling above. Quickly he checked the impulse to look up,
    although he was startled by it. He recovered himself on the
    instant and waited until under a pretext he could divert their
    attention to something else. Then he glanced hastily upward, as
    they looked in another direction. There, forming slowly, was
    another drop of blood, and it was about to fall.</p>

    <p>Locke had gained his object. As surely as though he had been
    brought face to face with Paul, he knew that he was lying on
    the floor of the attic above.</p>

    <p>Single-handed, against so many and in this shack, Locke
    realized that he could do nothing. He apologized gruffly for
    his intrusion, conveying the impression that he felt he had
    made a mistake, and backed his way to the door.</p>

    <p>In an instant the door to the attic stairs was flung open
    and Dora rushed into the room.</p>

    <p>"You fools!" she snarled at the surprised men who were just
    congratulating themselves on how they had put one over on
    Locke. "I tell you he's wise. He saw the blood. Look up above
    you. Now go get him."</p>

    <p>But the fishermen had no desire for this outside work and
    hung back, while Dora raved at them.</p>

    <p>From the ceiling, drop by drop, blood was falling, forming a
    little pool on the floor. Paul could not be moved now. They
    must make the best of it and be ready for any raid Locke might
    prepare.</p>

    <p>At Brent Rock Eva was conversing with her lawyer. Matters
    had reached such a state in the affairs of International
    Patents that it was evident, even to her, that some drastic
    action must be taken, and at once.</p>

    <p>In a corner of the room, coiled up in a big armchair, Zita
    was apparently reading a new magazine, but was, in reality,
    listening intently to every word that was being uttered.</p>

    <p>Finally Eva and the lawyer were in full accord, and she
    accompanied the elderly attorney to the door. As they parted,
    Zita strained her ears to hear the last words. She did not get
    it all, but quite enough to tell her what they had decided
    upon.</p>

    <p>"As my lawyer," she overheard Eva say, "I wish you to have
    Mr. Locke appointed receiver."</p>

    <p>There was some more she missed, but that was quite enough
    for Zita. She got out of the chair quickly and left the room
    without being observed, and a few moments later she had left
    the house.</p>

    <p>In a telephone-booth, not far from the cove fishing-village,
    Locke by this time had his chief of the Department of Justice
    on the wire.</p>

    <p>"I've located him, Chief," he telephoned, excitedly, "but it
    will take four good men to capture him."</p>

    <p>"I'll send them at once," the chief replied, as both hung up
    their receivers hurriedly.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in Herbert Balcom's sumptuous, semi-Oriental
    apartment two men were in earnest conversation. One was the
    owner, Balcom, the other that strange, half-demented being,
    Doctor Q, whose mind now, for the moment, seemed to be
    lucid.</p>

    <p>The matter under discussion was undoubtedly a weighty one,
    for both men sat with knitted brows, and for the moment, at
    least, seemed in a quandary about something.</p>

    <p>Suddenly there came a hurried ringing at the outside-door
    bell and Balcom leaped to his feet. They could hear the door
    opened, quick footsteps in the hallway, and then, without
    ceremony, the door was flung open and Dora burst into the
    room.</p>

    <p>Balcom scowled a welcome, for he hated this woman, who had,
    as he thought, spoiled the chances of his son with Eva. But
    Dora did not wait for the threatened outburst.</p>

    <p>"Hurry!" she cried. "You must do something. Paul has been
    wounded&mdash;never mind how&mdash;but he lies in a
    fishing-shack down at the cove&mdash;and they are going to
    arrest him&mdash;Locke is!"</p>

    <p>For the moment both men seemed to be stricken dumb, while
    Dora, in a state of wild excitement, pleaded for them to do
    something&mdash;anything to save the one person she loved.</p>

    <p>It was at this juncture that the door opened again,
    admitting another woman. It was Zita, very agitated, though, of
    course, under better control than Dora. Besides, Zita did not
    know what had happened to Paul, nor did she love him. It was
    merely that she felt that things could be made to play into her
    own hands if the news she brought were immediately acted
    upon.</p>

    <p>Hastily she told what she had overheard about the proposed
    receivership, and all four now&mdash;Balcom, Doctor Q, Dora,
    and Zita&mdash;talked excitedly.</p>

    <p>But it was plainly Balcom who was in command of the
    situation. Although livid with rage at the news he had heard,
    yet he maintained control of the others, directing what they
    should do with a decisiveness that was truly remarkable. It
    showed the mental force of the man, demonstrating how greatly
    he was to be feared by any bold enough to be his enemy. For
    Balcom loved that spoiled son of his and would hesitate at no
    act, not even at a crime, to save him from even what he justly
    deserved.</p>

    <p>At last their plan was formed, and all four departed their
    several ways to execute it.</p>

    <p>Balcom had decided upon going directly to Brent Rock. His
    ire had not abated one iota during the trip, either, and, as he
    almost ran up the steps to the mansion, he pushed the astounded
    butler to one side as though he were merely a piece of
    furniture.</p>

    <p>"Tell Miss Brent I want to see her at once," he
    threatened.</p>

    <p>The butler raised a hand deprecatingly at Balcom's tone, but
    Balcom, beside himself, smashed it down and strode toward the
    library just as Eva, hearing the voices, was coming out. For an
    instant she drew back in apprehension and amazement as Balcom
    advanced on her, still snarling.</p>

    <p>"See here, Eva," he hissed, "if Locke tries to arrest my
    son&mdash;he'll be killed."</p>

    <p>For the instant Eva was stunned. What did the man mean? But
    as Balcom showed no signs of regaining control of himself, and
    every moment became more abusive and violent, indignation gave
    place to every other sentiment, and she sharply ordered Balcom
    to leave the house.</p>

    <p>Threatening dire things and hinting even more if there were
    a receivership, Balcom strode out.</p>

    <p>Eva stood for a long time shocked into inaction. Then,
    slowly, fears for Locke's safety came uppermost and she paced
    back and forth the length of the hall.</p>

    <p>Finally the old butler came to her deferentially.</p>

    <p>"And did you notice, ma'am," he asked, "that during his
    tirade he mentioned about a cove fishing-village? Might I
    suggest that that is where Mr. Paul is and Mr. Locke will not
    be found far off?"</p>

    <p>Eva thought a moment, recognized the sound sense of the
    remark, and ordered that her car be brought. A few moments
    later she had taken the wheel and was soon out of sight of
    Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>Close pressed against a wall of a back lane of the cove
    fishing-village, Locke was standing, waiting for the men whom
    his chief had promised to send.</p>

    <p>Finally they came to him, first making their coming known to
    Locke by a peculiar low whistle.</p>

    <p>"The other two will be along directly," whispered one of the
    pair. "Thought it better not to come in a bunch."</p>

    <p>As Locke laid his plans, the other two came from out of the
    shadows.</p>

    <p>The entire party now moved cautiously toward Old Tom's
    shack. Just before they arrived one of the men said that he
    could see two figures entering the place. But as Locke had seen
    nothing, no attention was paid to the remark.</p>

    <p>Locke now placed one of his men on either side of the door.
    The other two he sent to the rear, so that they could surround
    the gang.</p>

    <p>He knocked at the door. This time it was immediately opened.
    Followed by the detectives with revolvers drawn, Locke rushed
    boldly into the shack, while his other two men closed in from
    the rear.</p>

    <p>The emissaries, finding themselves surrounded, would have
    capitulated, probably without a struggle, had not the old hag,
    to whom no one had paid much attention, picked up a small
    anchor and thrown it at Locke and the advancing detectives.</p>

    <p>As it was, the anchor struck Locke a glancing blow and he
    stumbled backward against one of his own men, upsetting him.
    That, of course, gave the advantage to the thugs, and they
    advanced, attacking savagely.</p>

    <p>It was at too close quarters, in the midst of such a mêlée,
    to use guns without danger of getting one of one's own party.
    Thus it was a primitive battle of brute force.</p>

    <p>Locke and the detectives were trained men, however, and were
    surely gaining the upper hand, so much so that Locke managed to
    tear himself loose and dash for the door leading to the attic.
    He opened it, and there, with revolver leveled at his head,
    stood De Luxe Dora.</p>

    <p>It was the work of only an instant to disarm her, however,
    and he rushed up the stairs, Dora after him.</p>

    <p>There was a body lying on the floor&mdash;Paul, undoubtedly,
    thought Locke.</p>

    <p>He took it by the shoulder and turned it over, then fell
    back in amazement, for there, smiling mockingly at him, was
    Zita!</p>

    <p>"You think you're pretty clever, don't you?" jeered
    Dora.</p>

    <p>But it was no time to bandy words, and Locke left them and
    rushed down the stairs just as a horde of emissaries swarmed up
    to meet him, reinforcements to the fisher thugs.</p>

    <p>For in some way the Automaton had been warned of Locke's
    presence, and with all the emissaries it could summon had
    hastened to Old Tom's shack.</p>

    <p>Most unfortunate of all, the Automaton and its men had
    arrived just behind the car bearing Eva, and she, not
    suspecting the danger, had entered the shack.</p>

    <p>Although she did not see Locke, she was overjoyed to see
    that the detectives held the upper hand. She had started to
    search for him, when there came a terrifying crash at the door
    and more emissaries, followed by the Automaton, came into the
    room.</p>

    <p>The detectives were almost instantly overpowered, and the
    mob made for the stairs just as Locke was descending.</p>

    <p>In that narrow space a most terrible battle took place. Man
    after man Locke hurled against his fellows, and they went
    crashing down, only to rise again and attack.</p>

    <p>Finally they came to hand-grips, and Locke, lunging
    furiously to free himself, threw his body against the partition
    of the stairway and it came crashing down, hurling Locke and
    the emissaries to the floor below.</p>

    <p>Locke was badly stunned, and before he could rise the
    emissaries had swathed him in the huge net that the old hag had
    been mending. Next they bound him with ropes until he was
    utterly helpless in the meshes of the net.</p>

    <p>Eva, half crazed with horror, was in a far corner, and the
    Automaton was advancing upon her. She was paralyzed with
    fear.</p>

    <p>What fate was in store for her&mdash;what for Locke?</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

    <p>The sharp crack of an automatic echoed through the shack.
    The detective known as Jim had come back to consciousness, and
    now, from behind an overturned table where he had fallen, he
    started to fire shot after shot into the mob of emissaries.</p>

    <p>He had fallen in a far corner and could be reached only
    after an attack of some paces, and even the emissaries,
    numerous as they were, hesitated to advance on a determined man
    placed in such an advantageous position. Furthermore, the
    diversion caused by the shots had other effects. The sound of
    the shots brought Locke fully out of his stunned condition and
    he started to struggle frantically in the meshes of the net
    that held him prisoner.</p>

    <p>The Automaton, for the moment, ceased to follow Eva, and
    moved over to its men in order to take command and to direct
    their movements, while yet another detective came to his senses
    and began to threaten the mob.</p>

    <p>Locke was threshing about and was slowly but surely freeing
    himself. An emissary threw a chair, and for a moment Locke lay
    still in pain. But in another moment he was working even more
    frantically at the ropes and the net that held him.</p>

    <p>Eva started over to help him, but he shouted to her to stand
    back, since that would bring her in line with the detectives'
    fire. The shots were flying over Locke's body as he struggled.
    Some of the emissaries went down; others found places of refuge
    behind which they hid.</p>

    <p>Finally Locke managed to kick his feet free of the net and,
    rolling and tossing, managed to work the meshes up about his
    shoulders and neck, thus releasing his hands. It was the work
    of an instant only, now, to slip the enveloping net over his
    head and he was free.</p>

    <p>Locke rolled out of the direction of the revolver-shots and
    toward Eva, who was now standing before a huge open
    fireplace.</p>

    <p>He was none too soon, for the moment that the Automaton saw
    that Locke had escaped the iron terror left the men and stalked
    ponderously over to crush out Locke's life.</p>

    <p>The two detectives fired point-blank at the monster and both
    shots took effect with a ringing, metallic sound. But they did
    not halt the Automaton an instant. Locke, reaching the
    fireplace, seized a pair of old tongs and threw firebrand after
    firebrand in the path of the advancing terror.</p>

    <p>To the Automaton fire was evidently quite another affair
    from mere puny bullets, for it not only paused, but came to a
    full stop, looking around as though in a quandary as to what to
    do against such a defense.</p>

    <p>This moment of hesitation gave Locke and Eva their
    opportunity. Calling to the detectives to cease firing a
    moment, they passed between friends and foes, dashed over to
    and up the attic stairs.</p>

    <p>As they reached the attic above they were just in time to
    see Zita, still dressed in Paul's clothes, and Dora, jump from
    the attic window.</p>

    <p>Although it was a low, rambling building, still it was a
    high jump, even for a man, and Locke was astounded that they
    should attempt such a thing, even in their undoubted state of
    panic.</p>

    <p>However, it gave Locke a splendid idea, which he acted upon
    immediately. Hooking his feet on the window-frame, he took hold
    of Eva's wrists firmly and swung her far out of the window.
    Held in this way, Eva was only a few feet from the ground, and
    when Locke released her she landed safely and almost without a
    jar.</p>

    <p>For Locke, always in perfect training, the jump offered no
    difficulties. In an instant he had rejoined her and they were
    running away from the shack toward Eva's waiting car.</p>

    <p>Locke had an almost overpowering desire to return to assist
    his detectives, whom he realized might be in sore straits, but
    he also realized that his first duty was to this girl who was
    in his charge, on whom the events through which they had just
    passed had had a nerve-racking effect. Again, he reflected, as
    he saw people coming down the beach, that the Automaton and his
    men would soon be outnumbered and glad to flee.</p>

    <p>Quentin and Eva had almost reached the motor which Eva had
    left at some distance from Old Tom's shack, and were passing a
    low clump of bushes, when a low moan fell upon their ears.</p>

    <p>At first Locke thought that it might be a trap and was for
    paying no attention to the sound, but Eva, woman-like,
    insisted. He investigated. Reclining on the ground, and looking
    more like a little boy in man's clothes, lay Zita.</p>

    <p>She was holding one ankle and her face showed that she must
    be in great pain.</p>

    <p>"Help me," she moaned. "When I jumped from the window I
    sprained my ankle. Dora helped me to this place and then she
    left me and drove away."</p>

    <p>Although this girl was his enemy, no thought of leaving her
    in this condition entered Locke's mind. Gently raising her from
    the ground, with the help of Eva, Locke supported her to the
    car.</p>

    <p>Locke still held Zita to ease her pain, while Eva took the
    wheel, and, although they could hear shouts and even shots
    behind them, Eva drove slowly in order not to add to Zita's
    misery. It showed the sympathy of their characters that, much
    as Locke and Eva felt that Zita had injured them, nevertheless,
    pausing in a flight from deadly peril, they found it in their
    hearts to be kind to an enemy.</p>

    <p>Arriving at Brent Rock, they carried Zita to her room and
    the family physician was sent for. He pronounced the injury
    slight and more of a strain than a sprain.</p>

    <p>While the doctor was at the house he also paid a visit to
    Brent, who, while his mental condition had remained as
    apparently hopeless as ever, had gained much in strength, owing
    to the diet and restful care. He was now able to sit up, fully
    dressed. As it was a case of drug poisoning, the doctor had
    thought it best not to allow the patient to relax too
    completely. But, whatever the strange drug that had stolen away
    Brent's reason, the effect showed no signs of departure, and
    they were as much in the dark as to the antidote as ever.</p>

    <p>A few moments after the doctor had left, when he made his
    morning call the next day, the counsel of the corporation was
    announced. He was shown into the library immediately and it was
    there that Locke and Eva went into conference with him.</p>

    <p>The attorney had brought with him many share-holders'
    proxies, and these he handed over to Eva.</p>

    <p>"These proxies," he was declaring, "give you absolute
    control, Miss Brent. With them you can force Mr. Balcom
    completely out of International Patents."</p>

    <p>"What's that you say?"</p>

    <p>It was Balcom himself who spoke. How the man had got past
    the butler, who certainly had no love for him, was mystifying.
    Yet here he was, ready and eager to defend his interests.</p>

    <p>"I was just telling Miss Brent," informed the lawyer,
    coldly, "that with these proxies which I have obtained and just
    handed to her, she was in complete control of the company."</p>

    <p>"And you, Mr. Balcom," interposed Locke, stepping forward,
    "will play no further part in the activities of the company.
    Miss Brent desires your resignation, to take effect
    immediately."</p>

    <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;this is unheard of&mdash;absurd!"
    sputtered Balcom. "I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;" And his rage got the
    better of him.</p>

    <p>"No, Mr. Balcom," again interrupted Locke, "you will do
    nothing. It is I who will give you twenty-four hours to arrange
    your affairs with the company before I order your
    removal&mdash;or arrest."</p>

    <p>Balcom tried to remonstrate, to plead his innocence of any
    wrong-doing. Finding no sympathy by taking this attitude, his
    manner changed abruptly and he attempted to bluster.</p>

    <p>A decisive movement toward the telephone on the part of
    Locke checked this and, chameleon-like, Balcom's usual suave
    manner came to the fore. He bowed himself out.</p>

    <p>"It will, of course, be as you say." He smiled oilily.</p>

    <p>Once in the hall, however, his manner changed again, and,
    darkly scowling and biting his thin lips, he was about to quit
    the place, when Zita, limping only slightly, intercepted
    him.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Balcom," she pleaded, "come out the back way. I must
    see you alone a moment."</p>

    <p>They tiptoed out to the grounds, and, behind a hedge where
    they could not be observed from the house, talked.</p>

    <p>"Tell me what has happened," demanded Zita.</p>

    <p>"Happened?" repeated Balcom. "Why, they've thrown me out of
    the company&mdash;at least, they think they have."</p>

    <p>His mind was working quickly, and after a pause he turned to
    Zita sharply. "Can you get Brent out of the house and bring him
    to me here behind this hedge at eight o'clock to-night?"</p>

    <p>Zita nodded an eager acquiescence and left him, returning to
    the house.</p>

    <p>That evening Locke, returning from a stroll around the
    grounds, noticed a movement in some shrubbery at the side of
    the foot-path. He went closer to investigate, and a
    rough-looking individual broke from cover and ran away through
    the underbrush as fast as he could go. It was too dark to
    follow and Locke hastened his steps to the house, fearing some
    new deviltry on the part of the Automaton or his
    emissaries.</p>

    <p>He had just entered the darkened hallway when, much to his
    surprise, he saw the figure of a man, leaning heavily on the
    arm of a woman, descending the stairs.</p>

    <p>He stepped behind some portières and waited until they
    reached the foot of the stairway. Then he stepped out and
    confronted them.</p>

    <p>Zita gave a startled cry, and would have fled had not Locke
    caught and held her. As for poor Brent, he simply stood there,
    swaying from side to side and smiling foolishly.</p>

    <p>Eva heard the commotion and came running down the stairs.
    She was amazed until Locke explained the situation to her. Then
    her indignation knew no bounds. Putting her arms around her
    father, she turned to Zita.</p>

    <p>"How dare you?" she demanded, scathingly. "For doing this
    you will leave this house immediately and&mdash;never
    return."</p>

    <p>Zita, for a moment, was on the verge of breaking down, but
    recovered herself and, with an angry retort on her lips, went
    out, slamming the door behind her.</p>

    <p>Zita slipped around the house and to the hedge designated by
    Balcom as their meeting-place.</p>

    <p>She was surprised but relieved when she did not find him
    there, and glanced at her wrist watch, which stood at a few
    minutes past eight. She was about to turn around when she
    caught sight of a bit of paper. Taking it, she
    read:</p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bring him to my
    rooms.</span><br />


    <p>That was all, and the message was unsigned.</p>

    <p>Zita greatly feared Balcom's wrath at her failure, but,
    nevertheless, she started for his apartment.</p>

    <p>At that moment Balcom and the mysterious Doctor Q were
    talking in the latter's dingy laboratory. Doctor Q's mind, for
    the time being, at least, seemed perfectly clear, and he had
    formulated a daring plan.</p>

    <p>"Send Locke word that you will give yourself up," he was
    saying, "but tell him that he must come to your apartment to
    get you. I will do the rest."</p>

    <p>Balcom left hurriedly and was driven directly home, where he
    got Locke on the telephone and repeated the instructions that
    Doctor Q had suggested.</p>

    <p>"Am I to understand that you intend to turn state's
    evidence?" questioned Locke, doubtfully.</p>

    <p>"Assuredly," hastened Balcom.</p>

    <p>"Then I'll be right over."</p>

    <p>As Balcom hung up the receiver he chuckled sardonically. He
    was just turning to an antique brazier to arrange for Locke's
    reception when Zita was announced and at once admitted.</p>

    <p>"I've failed, Mr. Balcom," she apologized, "failed
    miserably. Locke took Mr. Brent away from me&mdash;and they
    ordered me never to return to the house."</p>

    <p>"You little idiot!" Balcom almost hissed. "I'll not tolerate
    a failure, either. Get out!"</p>

    <p>Although Zita almost went on her knees in her pleading to
    him, Balcom was adamant, and finally she left in utter
    despair.</p>

    <p>Outside, she telephoned to Paul to see if she might induce
    him to use his influence in reinstating her in his father's
    good graces.</p>

    <p>As soon as Zita was gone Balcom busied himself with the
    ancient brazier and was standing before a small image of
    Buddha. He took a small package and from it poured a powder
    into the bowl of the brazier. Then, going to the table, he
    wrote a short note, after which he went to a divan and awaited
    Locke's coming.</p>

    <p>Balcom had not long to wait. A ring came at the door and
    Balcom leaped to his feet and lighted the powder in the
    brazier. Then he adjusted a gas-mask that Doctor Q had given
    him, and, returning to the divan, lay down, pulling a
    camel's-hair coverlet well over himself as he awaited
    results.</p>

    <p>There was a rap at the door and a peremptory demand for
    entrance&mdash;a pause&mdash;and a whispered consultation
    outside.</p>

    <p>"Open the door!" cried Locke, again.</p>

    <p>As there was no answer, heavy blows were rained upon the
    door, and finally it gave way.</p>

    <p>Three men stumbled into the room. They stared about, then
    started to search the place. One by one they started to cough.
    Locke, who was the farthest away from the brazier, seemed to be
    the least affected.</p>

    <p>Finally he spied the note on the table and snatched it up.
    By the dim light he read:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>You will never live to capture me. The deadly gas is
        even now killing you.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Locke gasped. There was the sound of a heavy fall behind
    him. He turned and saw that one of his men was down.</p>

    <p>He took a step forward, when the other pitched on his
    face.</p>

    <p>Locke tried to rescue them, but by this time the deadly
    fumes had reached him and he, too, fell to the floor, coughing
    his life away.</p>

    <p>At that moment Balcom got up from the divan and, stepping
    over Locke's prostrate body, left the place, forgetting to
    close the door behind him.</p>

    <p>When Zita telephoned Paul, Paul made an immediate
    appointment for her to meet him at Doctor Q's, and when she
    arrived there Paul was already in conference with the
    doctor.</p>

    <p>Over the telephone Zita had already given Paul a brief
    account of what had happened, and thus the two men were
    prepared with a plan when she arrived.</p>

    <p>"Get Eva to the hypnotist's on River Street," instructed
    Doctor Q. "Tell her that I have been hypnotized and that under
    the spell I will tell all."</p>

    <p>It was a desperate thing for Zita to attempt, after treating
    the Brents so shamelessly. But there was no alternative. For
    she knew well that, with Balcom, only a success would offset
    her miserable failure earlier in the evening. Besides, were not
    her fortunes tied up with Balcom&mdash;or perhaps with Paul?
    She did not demur, but left immediately for Brent Rock to make
    the attempt, revolving in her mind how she was to do it.</p>

    <p>Zita had difficulty in persuading Eva to see her at all,
    but, once she had succeeded, the possibility that all the
    mystery might be cleared up appealed strongly to Eva. For Zita
    had framed her story cleverly and was playing desperately.</p>

    <p>"Then I'll meet you at the hypnotist's in about half an
    hour," agreed Eva, after Zita had told her how friendless she
    herself was and how both Balcom and Paul had refused her
    aid.</p>

    <p>Zita left Brent Rock alone and was passing a dark corner
    when a hand reached out and grasped her by the arm and she
    heard a voice that she recognized.</p>

    <p>"Your failure has made me redouble my efforts," it hissed.
    "I have just killed Locke in my apartment and I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>It was Balcom. But Zita waited to hear no more. Secretly she
    had always loved Locke. Though she had worked against him, the
    very thought that he might be dead shocked her. She tore
    herself from the grasp of Balcom before she could hear more and
    ran like a deer toward the apartment.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, it was not far. She tore up-stairs and through
    the door that Balcom had left open.</p>

    <p>Everything was as Balcom had left it, except that now the
    three men lay quite still. Zita staggered over to a window and
    threw it open.</p>

    <p>Next she got water and extinguished the still smoldering
    powder. Then, falling on her knees, she tried to help the
    stricken men.</p>

    <p>Not much time did she spend with the others, but to Locke
    with great tenderness she gave most of her attention. Tenderly
    she bathed his brow and frantically tried even to breathe her
    breath into his burning lungs.</p>

    <p>Finally she was rewarded by seeing him open his eyes and
    gaze around. He looked up at her.</p>

    <p>"I'll atone for all the wrong I've done," she sobbed,
    "only&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She would have asked him to love her, but she knew that it
    was useless and the thought of Eva, caused the words to stick
    in her throat.</p>

    <p>Locke did not understand, and the look on his face showed
    it.</p>

        </a>
        reviving from the effects of chlorine gas, locke is much
        surprised to see it is zita who has resuscitated him
    </div>

    <p>"I didn't want to give you up," wailed Zita, now forgetting
    herself. "I loved you. To prove it&mdash;I will help you now.
    The&mdash;the girl you love is in terrible danger&mdash;you
    must hurry."</p>

    <p>It was only too true. Eva had driven immediately to the
    hypnotist's, and he had been instructed about her coming. At
    his door she had knocked, and an old, evil-visaged man, in
    flowing robes which were marked in cabalistic signs, had opened
    the door. In true fakir fashion he salaamed almost to the floor
    while in flowery language he bade her enter.</p>

    <p>Fearfully Eva stepped within. Signs of the zodiac, of
    cross-bones and skulls, on walls and ceiling met her gaze
    everywhere. In an alcove Eva could see a noosed rope hanging,
    for what purpose she knew not. But its presence she felt was
    sinister.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I was told that a Doctor Q would be here," Eva
    faltered. "I do not see him."</p>

    <p>"Gracious lady," bowed the hyponotist, "I will bring him at
    once. Pray be seated."</p>

    <p>Eva seated herself before a table upon which there stood a
    curious stand, supporting many mirrors. She examined it
    closely, and as she did so they all began to move. Each mirror
    moved on its own axis and she watched with fatal curiosity. For
    now a bright light was cast from behind her on the revolving
    mirrors and they formed a scintillating kaleidoscope that was
    bewildering in its intricacy.</p>

    <p>Eva quickly became fascinated. Then she was conscious of a
    drowsy feeling stealing over her. She strove to rise, but her
    knees refused to support her and she fell back in her
    chair.</p>

    <p>The hypnotist now shut off the machine and, stepping before
    Eva, made several passes with his hands.</p>

    <p>Eva's eyes closed. The hypnotist turned and made a signal.
    Several panels opened simultaneously and into the room there
    came a number of emissaries, who crept upon the now completely
    hypnotized girl.</p>

    <p>Nor was that all. A sound, as of the clanking of chains, was
    heard, and through an aperture in the wall larger than the
    others there stalked the Automaton.</p>

    <p>At this very instant Locke and Zita burst into the room and
    rushed toward Eva.</p>

    <p>The hypnotist slipped around them both and in a moment had
    caught Zita in his arms. She struggled to escape, beating him
    with her little fists in a fury of rage and fear. But he held
    her, and an emissary, bringing ropes, with his help bound her
    securely.</p>

    <p>As for Locke, he made a frantic attempt to reach Eva, but
    his way was blocked by a score of emissaries and the Automaton
    himself. Desperately Locke dashed at the iron monster, only to
    be hurled to the floor as though he were a tiny child.</p>

    <p>In another moment the emissaries had bound him and carried
    him to the alcove in which hung the noosed rope.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:400px;">
        <a href="images/321.jpg"

             alt="LOCKE IS BOUND IN THE 'DEATH NOOSE'" /></a>
        locke is bound in the "death noose"
    </div>

    <p>The hypnotist now pulled a lever and the method of the death
    intended for Locke was revealed. Directly under the suspended
    rope was a trap-door, which opened. Locke gazed down into
    blackness, nothingness. An emissary threw some small, heavy
    object into the yawning hole. For a long time nothing was
    heard. Then finally, far, far below there came to their ears
    the sound of a distant splash.</p>

    <p>The fiendish plan was simple&mdash;to hang him and then to
    cut the rope. His body would go hurtling down to the
    subterranean river below and be carried out to sea.</p>

    <p>The hypnotist reversed the lever. The trap-door closed.
    Locke was dragged beneath the rope and it was adjusted around
    his neck.</p>

    <p>Even in this awful moment his sole thought was of Eva. Would
    they throw her, unconscious, down the same yawning trap?</p>

    <p>Powerless, he stood bound, fascinated, as he saw three
    emissaries seize her. But instead of dragging her to the trap,
    they dragged her toward one of the panels in the wall.</p>

    <p>What nameless torture was in store for her?</p>

    <p>He struggled furiously to get free to rush to her, but the
    noose only tightened on his neck.</p>

    <p>The hypnotist stepped to the lever that operated the trap
    under Locke's feet and began to pull the lever down.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

    <p>With a crash the hypnotist dropped unconscious to the floor
    as the hypnotic machine started to revolve rapidly. The
    emissaries turned from Locke and were dazzled by the blinding
    flashes from the whirling mirrors.</p>

    <p>It was Zita who caused all the commotion. Unnoticed by the
    thugs, who were intent on sending Locke to his death and
    dragging Eva through the panel, Zita had managed to free
    herself from her bonds and, true to her promise to Locke that
    she would help him, she had risked all for his sake.</p>

    <p>Once free from the ropes, she had seized a heavy bronze vase
    and, at just the critical moment of danger, had hurled it at
    the hypnotist's head, striking him a terrific blow that had
    felled him and left him unconscious on the floor before he
    could spring the trap. She had then set the mechanical hypnotic
    machine in motion, and, standing behind it, was herself
    practically invisible. It all happened so quickly that it
    seemed like a miracle.</p>

    <p>Locke, his hope revived, swiftly grasped the one chance for
    life that was left to him. By contracting his muscles he was
    able to slip out of the ropes which bound his arms. But since
    the noosed rope around his neck held him so that his toes
    barely touched the floor of the trap, he could not, try as he
    might, manage to get the noose free.</p>

    <p>Suddenly a plan flashed across his mind. Hanging from the
    ceiling a few feet in front of him he could see an enormous
    chandelier. Throwing his hands above his head, he grasped the
    rope, thus relieving the strain on his neck. Then, snapping his
    body backward, his feet came in contact with the wall. With
    tremendous force he kicked out, causing his body to swing in an
    arc toward the chandelier.</p>

    <p>It was not until he had wrapped his legs about the branches
    of the chandelier that the emissaries noticed what he was
    doing, so fascinated were they by the revolving mirrors. Even
    then they could scarcely resist the auto-hypnotic powers of the
    contrivance. Finally, however, with a shout they came to the
    attack.</p>

    <p>Locke was now hanging head downward. With one hand he
    succeeded in loosening the noose from about his neck, while
    with the other he struck out, hitting an emissary a fearful
    swinging blow that sent the fellow staggering backward, to fall
    against the lever controlling the trap-door.</p>

    <p>With a crash the trap was sprung, with the pit yawning
    beneath it. Struggling, striking, grappling with his
    assailants, Locke managed to hurl three of them to their deaths
    in the underground river below.</p>

    <p>Horror-stricken at the fate of their companions, the other
    emissaries stepped back, when, to add to their confusion, Zita,
    with remarkable strength for so frail a girl, lifted the stand
    of mirrors and hurled it among them.</p>

    <p>Locke somersaulted to the floor and, seizing the broken
    stand, used it as a weapon with deadly effect.</p>

    <p>The emissaries turned and fled.</p>

    <p>An instant later Locke started to the panel through which
    Eva had been dragged, when he heard steps from the other side.
    It was the emissaries who had seized Eva, coming back to see
    what all the rumpus was about. Locke, forewarned, slipped close
    to the wall, and, as they passed through the panel, one at a
    time, he was able to fell them to the floor.</p>

    <p>Then he rushed through the panel just in time to see Eva,
    pursued by the Automaton, running toward him.</p>

    <p>The very strangeness of her terrible adventure had brought
    Eva out of the hypnotic state into which she had been thrown
    and she clung to Locke as though she were a child.</p>

    <p>Locke took her in his arms and, swiftly evading the
    slow-moving monster, dashed back to the hypnotic room, calling
    to Zita to run to the street. Thus all three were able to make
    good their escape.</p>

    <p>Eva had purposely left her motor turning over, and therefore
    it was barely an instant after they were in the street before
    they were streaking out of that quarter of the town.</p>

    <p>Zita was now overwhelmed by her feelings, but it was Eva
    herself who spoke first.</p>

    <p>"Forgive me, Zita," begged Eva, in the rush of her emotions
    forgetting all that Zita had done. "But for you, both of us
    would now be dead."</p>

    <p>For some moments Zita could not reply in her silent sadness
    at seeing the joy of Locke with this girl.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I forgive you?" she murmured, at length. "It is for
    you to forgive me." She paused a moment and choked back a sob;
    then added, bravely, "I&mdash;I can even wish for your
    happiness, my dear; my hope is dead."</p>

    <p>Only Locke understood, and as he watched Zita he resolved to
    do all he could for her, realizing that some one else had made
    her a victim of her love and jealousy.</p>

    <p>All breathed a sigh of relief when at last they came again
    in sight of the lights of Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>There was just the trace of a shadow to cloud the momentary
    happiness at their safe arrival, as, on the steps, Zita refused
    to enter.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I must say good-by," she murmured, wistfully,
    turning to go out into the night alone.</p>

    <p>Nothing that either Locke or Eva could say seemed to swerve
    her purpose.</p>

    <p>"Can't you see?" she exclaimed, finally, turning to Locke.
    "Balcom, Paul, and Doctor Q all trust me now. I can help you
    solve the mystery better if I leave the house."</p>

    <p>This was so evident that Locke and Eva were forced to
    consent. They took her back to the city, leaving her where she
    could be unobserved, then returned in a very hopeful mood again
    to Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>"I think she can and will help us," declared Eva,
    intuitively.</p>

    <p>"Yes," agreed Locke, slowly, "and if Zita finds the record
    of her birth I believe we shall solve the mystery."</p>

    <p>Worn out with the terrors through which she had passed, Eva
    bade Locke an affectionate good-night and went to her room,
    while he went to the laboratory and tried again to find an
    antidote for the Madagascar madness, a work that kept him up
    late and to which he returned again early the following
    morning.</p>

    <p>It was on that following day, in the River Road apartment of
    De Luxe Dora, that Paul and she were having a demi-monde
    lovers' quarrel. Paul was intoxicated, and Dora may have been
    angry about that. Or it may have been that she was jealous of
    some other woman. However, they were quarreling fiercely when
    there came a knock at the door.</p>

    <p>"You open it," flashed Dora to Paul.</p>

    <p>He demurred a moment, then, changing his mind, consented and
    crossed to the door, while Dora ran to her own room and
    hid.</p>

    <p>Paul was very much surprised to find that the visitor was
    Zita, much excited.</p>

    <p>"I want you to help me on something of great importance,"
    she exclaimed, almost before she had entered.</p>

    <p>"Why, certainly! Anything you desire!" hiccoughed Paul.
    "Come on in."</p>

    <p>Zita entered the apartment and they crossed over to the
    chaise-longue, where Zita made her direct plea.</p>

    <p>"Help me find the record of my birth," she begged.</p>

    <p>Paul pulled his wandering wits together and thought a
    moment; then a particularly crafty look came into his eyes as
    he detached a key from his key-ring.</p>

    <p>"Here, take this," he directed. "It's the key to my father's
    apartment. The records you want are there. He and I have
    quarreled and you can go as far as you like."</p>

    <p>Zita took the key eagerly, thanked Paul profusely, and
    started for the door.</p>

    <p>She had barely passed the threshold before Dora, who had
    heard all, was at the telephone in her own room and was angrily
    calling up Balcom at his apartment.</p>

    <p>Balcom, assisted by his Madagascan servant, was at the
    moment packing a trunk, perhaps preparatory to a hasty flight,
    should that become necessary. The moment the telephone rang he
    picked up the receiver and nearly choked with anger as he heard
    Dora's whispered voice over the wire.</p>

    <p>"Paul has given Zita the key to your apartment," Dora
    hastened, "and she is coming over to steal the record of her
    birth."</p>

    <p>"She is&mdash;eh? Well, I'll take care of that," growled
    Balcom, as he rang off.</p>

    <p>Balcom went to a drawer in the table and from it took a
    large book. Rapidly he turned over the pages until he found
    what he wanted. Then he made an erasure and an entry and
    replaced the book in the drawer. Next he called the
    servant.</p>

    <p>"When she comes, you make her a prisoner," he directed.
    "Understand?"</p>

    <p>The Madagascan nodded and raised one of Balcom's hands to
    his own forehead as a sign of his fidelity.</p>

    <p>Balcom went out and the servant stepped into the empty trunk
    to await the arrival of Zita.</p>

    <p>But it was a very different person with whom the Madagascan
    had to contend in the end.</p>

    <p>On leaving Dora's apartment, Zita telephoned Brent Rock, and
    Locke answered immediately. Locke readily agreed to make the
    search of Balcom's apartment in Zita's stead.</p>

    <p>When the Madagascan heard a key in the door he stealthily
    peeped from his hiding-place and saw, instead of Zita,
    Locke.</p>

    <p>Locke's back was turned, and the Madagascan, undaunted,
    sprang from the trunk and leaped, catlike, on Locke's back. But
    he had not reckoned on his antagonist. Locke, always on guard,
    was not taken quite by surprise. He caught the savage in a
    jiu-jitsu hold, throwing him over his head to land in a far
    corner of the room.</p>

    <p>In spite of the fall, the Madagascan bounded to his feet,
    like a rubber ball, but a few stiff jabs from Locke soon took
    all the fight out of him and he lay still, completely knocked
    out.</p>

    <p>Locke made a hurried but systematic search of the room, and
    finally found the book that he sought, taking it and returning
    to Eva at Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>After telephoning, Zita went directly to Doctor Q's
    laboratory, to which she was admitted after he had seen her
    through his periscope annunciator.</p>

    <p>The doctor was fumbling with a test-tube, from which some
    heavy fumes were issuing. He motioned her to a chair, near a
    table upon which were many papers which looked to Zita as
    though they might be of importance. Always quick to act, Zita
    raised her hand as if to arrange her hair, and as she did so
    she purposely knocked the test-tube out of the doctor's hand.
    The acid spattered on some of the papers, quickly setting them
    afire.</p>

    <p>Doctor Q, wildly excited, started to beat out the flames,
    and in so doing allowed several unseared letters to flutter to
    the floor. One in particular arrested Zita's attention. It was
    a drawing, a plan of some sort, and was marked, "Plan of
    Den."</p>

    <p>Zita placed her foot on it, and, while Doctor Q was engaged
    with the small blaze, she reached down and, hastily folding it,
    thrust it into one of the low shoes she was wearing. Then she
    went to Doctor Q's assistance and in a jiffy the fire was out.
    The doctor was furiously angry at her, and, feeling that she
    had accomplished all that she might expect, she expressed her
    regrets for the accident and went out before his anger became
    any worse.</p>

    <p>Thus it was that Zita arrived at Brent Rock only a few
    moments after Locke, whom she found in the library with Eva,
    turning over the pages of the record he had secured at
    Balcom's.</p>

    <p>The record purported to be a record of marriages of Wallace
    County, New York, and Locke finally found an entry that read,
    "Peter Brent and Rita Dane."</p>

    <p>For a moment Zita was stunned. It was her mother's name.</p>

    <p>Locke smiled. "Yes, Zita," he said, quietly, "for a moment
    Eva and I were surprised, too. But it's a palpable forgery.
    Balcom has tried to prove that you and Eva are half-sisters,
    but look."</p>

    <p>He handed her a powerful magnifying-glass and through it the
    clumsy forgery stood out in all its crudeness, showing plainly
    where other names had been erased and these inserted.</p>

    <p>Zita was greatly disappointed, for she had thought that at
    last she would establish her identity. Then she remembered the
    paper she had hidden in her shoe. She slipped the paper out and
    handed it to Locke, who was greatly excited over its
    importance.</p>

    <p>They were still studying it when Locke heard a strange
    noise, as of shuffling feet, in the hallway. He jumped to the
    door, and there, in the dim light of the stairway leading down
    to the Graveyard of Genius, he saw a knot of men carrying
    another man, who was evidently helpless. Locke started forward,
    but they were gone.</p>

    <p>Eva hurried up-stairs to her father's room, fearing
    something was wrong.</p>

    <p>"Father's gone!" she cried, despairingly.</p>

    <p>Locke threw himself full against the door at the head of the
    cellar stairs which the men had slammed shut. He tried to
    batter it down, but it was too strongly built. Then he drew his
    revolver and with the barrel started to push out the pins from
    the hinges. He worked feverishly and succeeded in driving the
    top pin out. Then, using it as a lever, he was able to pull the
    door from its frame.</p>

    <p>He dashed down the stairs, but was late by only the fraction
    of a second, as a metal hand was just closing the huge door to
    the Graveyard of Genius. He fumbled at the secret combination,
    and as he was doing so Eva and Zita joined him.</p>

    <p>The door swung open and they rushed through. But the place
    was deserted.</p>

    <p>"They've carried your father through some secret passage,"
    exclaimed Locke. "That would explain much that is strange that
    has happened about the house, too."</p>

    <p>Just then Zita stepped forward with the plan in her hand.
    "See," she cried, "there is a secret passage marked on
    this."</p>

    <p>Locke studied the plan for some time, but whoever had drawn
    it had carefully concealed both the exact location of the
    passage and the method by which it was reached. As he searched,
    however, an idea occurred to Locke.</p>

    <p>"I'll rig a trap with a camera," he decided, finally.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later he returned to the room with his special
    quick-shutter camera, a flash-bag, and a ball of light twine.
    Carefully he focused the camera on the wall where the plan
    showed the secret passage to be. Then he rigged up the
    flash-bag and connected the whole with the twine, which he
    strung all about the Graveyard of Genius, so that, should any
    part of the wall move, it would cause the twine to break which
    in turn would at the same time release the shutter of the
    camera and explode the powder of the flashlight. Thus, without
    any direct human agency, a photograph would be taken.</p>

    <p>Next he attached wires and ran them to the library above,
    where he installed an annunciator, the needle of which would
    indicate when the trap was sprung and the picture taken.
    Fascinated, the two girls watched. Eva was almost fainting with
    grief at the terrible fate that had overtaken her father. Even
    in his sickness, at least she had had him. But now he was
    gone&mdash;to what she could only guess. Locke tried to console
    her as they paced the library above, even though he realized
    that such consolation was hollow.</p>

    <p>It was perhaps half an hour later when suddenly the needle
    of the annunciator began to vibrate rapidly. All leaped to
    their feet and ran down the stairs to the Graveyard.</p>

    <p>At once Locke rushed to the camera, put in a slide, and took
    out the plate-holder. Then they hurried up to his
    laboratory.</p>

    <p>There Locke procured a developing-bag and started to work.
    Nervously and impatiently Eva and Zita watched him at his
    task.</p>

    <p>At last the negative was ready and Locke drew it from the
    bag and held it to the light.</p>

    <p>There, glaring out of the plate, was the devilish face of
    Balcom!</p>

    <p>Eva and Zita both uttered a cry of astonishment and
    consternation. Even Locke was amazed. But the strongest feeling
    he had was anger as he turned to them.</p>

    <p>"You two take this plan," he exclaimed. "It shows a den with
    an exit indicated. Get some one to go with you; find the place
    and wait for me there. I can find the secret entrance from the
    Graveyard from this negative&mdash;and I'm going through
    it."</p>

    <p>Balcom, in the passageway between the Graveyard of Genius
    and the Automaton's den, was livid with fury. He realized that
    his picture had been taken, surmised that the secret passage
    would be found and that some assault on the den would be
    attempted. But he had had no time to locate the camera, which
    Locke had hidden well, nor had he dared to search longer for it
    when he heard Locke bounding down the stairs from the
    library.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, he had retreated and hastened back through the
    passageway into the Automaton's den.</p>

    <p>"Quick!" he shouted to the horde of emissaries in the place.
    "Bring dynamite, electric wires, and a rack-bar. They think
    they have us trapped. But if they try to follow me here, I tell
    you it will mean certain death to them."</p>

    <p>The emissaires hastened to obey him. They brought the
    explosive and the means to detonate it, and carried the stuff
    into the passageway, where they made the connections. An
    emissary stepped forward and volunteered to use the rack-bar
    when the time came, but Balcom waved him away.</p>

    <p>"No," he growled. "No one can take my revenge from me. I'll
    do the killing."</p>

    <p>The emissaries fell back and went into the den.</p>

    <p>Balcom was making some final adjustments when the great rock
    separating the passageway from the Graveyard of Genius swung
    slowly on its balanced hinges.</p>

    <p>Startled from his work, even though he had expected the
    thing, Balcom looked up, and in the passageway caught a glimpse
    of the dim outline of his arch-enemy, Locke.</p>

    <p>Balcom had been right. Locke had found the clue to the
    secret entrance to the tunnel.</p>

    <p>He worked feverishly to complete the final connection, but
    almost before he finished Locke charged and the battle was
    on.</p>

    <p>Up and down the passageway they fought. Although Locke was
    the younger man, yet in Balcom he found a giant of
    strength.</p>

    <p>It was a fight between these two alone, for no emissary, no
    Automaton, now entered that passage of death.</p>

    <p>Neither uttered a sound. Neither had a weapon. It was the
    primitive struggle of man to man for life.</p>

    <p>But now Locke's youth and clean living began to tell in his
    favor and he sensed that his adversary was weakening. He
    redoubled his efforts.</p>

    <p>After a particularly vicious blow from Locke, Balcom threw
    up his hands and toppled over backward&mdash;in the direction
    of the rack-bar itself.</p>

    <p>Locke tried to throw Balcom's body out of the way. It was
    too late. With a thud Balcom crashed full upon the plunger,
    driving it home.</p>

    <p>There was a blinding flash, a dull roar, and the earth
    rocked. Huge boulders were tossed about like feathers and the
    roof of the passage caved in.</p>

    <p>Balcom was killed instantly. Locke, with better fortune, had
    been hurled to the ground, where the earth and rocks, in
    falling, had formed a sort of arch over his body.</p>

    <p>He was alive, though barely conscious. He knew that soon a
    search would be made for him. But, buried under tons of earth
    and rock, could any rescuers reach him in time? Was this the
    end?</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

    <p>For a long time Locke lay quite still. The shock to his
    nervous system had been terrific, and, although physically
    almost uninjured, he had lost his usual grip on himself and
    felt very helpless.</p>

    <p>He felt terribly tired. The thought came to him that he had
    done enough, reached his limit of endurance. He craved sleep, a
    long sleep, and forgetfulness.</p>

    <p>But youth and the undying desire for life and accomplishment
    won over this deadly mood and he began to take note of his
    position. His mind became clearer and the ringing in his ears,
    caused by the explosion, gradually passed away.</p>

    <p>Then, like a flash, the question entered his mind of how he
    was able, buried under tons of debris, to breathe so freely.
    Why was the air not vitiated?</p>

    <p>He tried to move slowly and quietly so as not to dislodge
    any of the rocks that formed an arch over his body. He
    succeeded beyond his expectations, for his body was in a sort
    of natural pocket and not one of his limbs was inextricably
    bound. Thus, twisting his body, he managed to draw himself into
    what seemed to be an even more open space.</p>

    <p>He hardly dared to breathe, so fearful was he that any
    moment he might reach a point where further progress would be
    impossible. He moved slowly, gropingly, then suddenly he
    recoiled in horror, for his hand had come in contact with
    something which he recognized to be a man's face.</p>

    <p>In his shaken condition it was some seconds before he could
    control the wild jangling of his nerves. Then he searched his
    pockets and, finding a match, lighted it. There, covered to the
    armpits by dirt and rocks, was the body of Balcom, whose last
    act before his own death had been an attempt to murder
    Locke.</p>

    <p>Locke shuddered and redoubled his efforts to escape from the
    gruesome place. There still remained a small hole through which
    he must climb. But he negotiated it successfully, and in
    another moment he was aboveground and free.</p>

    <p>Eva and Zita had followed Locke's instructions, but had not
    waited to find any one to go with them to the exit from the
    den. Nor did they wait at the exit more than a few minutes.</p>

    <p>Eva had taken a small electric torch with her, and, becoming
    impatient at the non-appearance of Locke, she flashed it about
    as she followed the lines and marks indicated on the plan of
    the den.</p>

    <p>She and Zita were surprised at the magnitude of the entrance
    passageway they uncovered. They had had to make a detour in
    order to reach the beach at a point where it was indicated that
    the exit of the den would be found, and even with the plan,
    which they consulted at every step, they almost missed their
    objective, for the cleft in the rocks slanted inward and was
    difficult to see even when one was standing directly in front
    of it.</p>

    <p>They had peered into the cavern and were waiting when they
    heard the explosion. They gazed at each other questioningly and
    with apprehension.</p>

    <p>"What do you think it is?" asked Eva, questioningly.</p>

    <p>Zita could, of course, offer no explanation and did not
    try.</p>

    <p>Impulsively both girls took a very foolish chance. Both had
    thought of Locke and they started to run into the cave entrance
    and toward the sound of the explosion.</p>

    <p>Zita was in the lead, and it was at this moment that the
    panic-stricken emissaries came tumbling and fighting their way
    from the den. Zita shrieked to Eva to save herself, and Eva,
    although unwilling to leave her, knew that now she could do
    nothing to save Zita, and took her only chance of escape.</p>

    <p>As for Zita, the emissaries were too frightened to pay any
    attention to her. But behind them came the iron monster,
    without nerves, it seemed. The Automaton saw her and pinned her
    to the rock wall until she was unconscious. Then, picking her
    up as though she were a feather, it carried her out to the
    beach.</p>

    <p>Locke, the moment he freed himself from the hole which had
    so nearly been his grave, ran staggering toward the beach, for
    he felt instinctively that Eva and Zita were in danger.</p>

    <p>Eva and Locke must have started at about the same time, she
    in her flight away from the Automaton, and Locke to find the
    den exit, for they met on the cliffside.</p>

    <p>"Thank God you are safe!" exclaimed Eva.</p>

    <p>Locke impulsively threw his arms about her and kissed her as
    they related their narrow escapes.</p>

    <p>Locke resolved to follow the trail of the Automaton and to
    rescue Zita. Also he had hopes of rescuing Eva's father at the
    same time. Eva wished to accompany him, but he would not think
    of it, and insisted that she return to Brent Rock and keep all
    the doors barricaded. In fact, he followed her almost to the
    house and saw that she entered safely, then hurried back to the
    beach.</p>

    <p>With the aid of Eva's electric torch, which she had given
    him, it was no difficult task to trace the huge footsteps of
    the Automaton, though, one by one, the footprints of the
    emissaries took divergent directions, probably for the very
    purpose of confusing just such a pursuit.</p>

    <p>He followed the main track, however, until he came to the
    banks of a small stream, and there the trail was completely
    lost, for the monster had stepped into the water. Locke waded
    to the other bank and hunted for further tracks, but there were
    none to be found. The Automaton had undoubtedly waded up-stream
    to the point where he had decided to dispose of Zita.</p>

    <p>Nothing daunted, Locke started wading upstream. This stream
    ran in a gully between the rocks and the cliffs on either side,
    which were very high. Time and time again Locke thought of
    turning back for more searchers. But he hated to return to Eva
    without at least some news, and therefore he persisted.</p>

    <p>He was at last rewarded, for just as he was about to turn to
    the right where the stream made a bend, he thought he heard a
    low laugh. He stopped dead in his tracks. Again the sound of
    the broken laughter came to him.</p>

    <p>Cautiously Locke moved slowly forward until he could see
    around the bend.</p>

    <p>It was a strange sight that met his gaze. Under an enormous
    overhanging rock he saw about fifteen men standing, while
    against the cliff he could distinguish the form of a girl. It
    was undoubtedly Zita. Sitting on a rock and quite close to her
    was Peter Brent.</p>

    <p>The emissaries were clustered around the central figure,
    which was waving its arms of steel and indicating what they
    should do. As the Automaton gesticulated, tiny points of fire
    gleamed from its eyes.</p>

    <p>Seen in the light of the lanterns held by the emissaries,
    the Automaton never looked more terrifying. Even Locke himself,
    who had encountered the monster so often, felt a cold chill as
    he watched him and his men.</p>

    <p>Locke turned noiselessly, for well he knew that alone he
    could do nothing. He started to retrace his steps to Brent
    Rock, and no sooner had he arrived there than he told Eva that
    her father still lived and was uninjured, and that Zita was
    safe in the new den of the Automaton which he had discovered.
    Then he telephoned to his chief to send officers immediately to
    Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>After the explosion that had killed Balcom and had come so
    near to killing Locke, when he had finally rescued himself and
    had drawn himself out of the hole, there was one who watched
    him.</p>

    <p>It was none other than that mysterious being, Doctor Q. What
    twist of that disordered brain had brought him to the spot was
    not at once evident. However, as soon as Locke had left to go
    toward Eva, Doctor Q came from his hiding-place, madly smiling
    and wagging his head. He peered into the hole and, seeing
    nothing, lighted a match and thrust it far down into the
    darkness.</p>

    <p>There was a sharp intake of his breath, for the match
    revealed to him the dead face of Herbert Balcom.</p>

    <p>Doctor Q drew back and stood erect.</p>

    <p>"Dead!" he muttered, as he ran his fingers through his hair
    dazedly.</p>

    <p>"Dead!"</p>

    <p>A strange thing happened. The mad light fled from the eyes
    of Doctor Q and the twisted brain seemed to become clear.</p>

    <p>Suddenly in the very field the old man knelt down and prayed
    a thankful prayer for his recovery.</p>

    <p>What was the strange power which Balcom had wielded over
    him, which death had snapped?</p>

    <p>The officers arrived at Brent Rock and Locke was ready. The
    party left immediately to go to the rescue of Brent and Zita,
    and it took them only a short time to reach the spot which
    Locke had located.</p>

    <p>Disposing some of his force below the hanging rock, Locke
    and some others went farther upstream. The two parties looked
    at their watches, waiting a certain time agreed on.</p>

    <p>Then the two parties moved toward each other. As they came
    in sight of the spot, Locke experienced a keen disappointment.
    He could see no one. Advancing farther, he discovered Brent
    still on the same rock. Guarding him were three emissaries.
    That was all. Zita, the Automaton, and the other emissaries
    were gone.</p>

    <p>The three emissaries, seeing the numbers opposed to them,
    did not even offer to resist. They were placed under arrest,
    but nothing could induce them to tell where the others had
    gone.</p>

    <p>To fail Zita after she had so nobly saved his life in the
    lair of the hypnotist was an unwelcome thought to Locke, and he
    resolved to rescue her at any risk. But first he felt he must
    restore Brent to his daughter, and therefore the party returned
    to Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>Eva was beside herself with joy at the safe return of her
    father, and led him tenderly to his room and sent immediately
    for the doctor in order that he might not suffer from his
    exposure.</p>

    <p>While this was going on at Brent Rock, Paul Balcom was
    rifling his father's papers in the apartment where Balcom had
    lived. He had unceremoniously thrown letters and documents all
    over the floor in his mad search for something. Finally he
    found what he was looking for, and, smiling triumphantly as he
    read the paper, he thrust it into his pocket and hurriedly left
    the place, not stopping even to pick up the papers scattered
    all about.</p>

    <p>Zita had evidently been watching the house, for no sooner
    had he left than she ran up the front steps of the Balcom
    apartment.</p>

    <p>In some way she had procured a key and let herself in. Then
    began a feverish search very similar to that which Paul had
    instituted. Only, this time Zita picked up all the papers,
    arranging them and placing them back in the drawers, after
    scanning their contents.</p>

    <p>She had almost finished when a small book lying in a distant
    corner of the room caught her eye.</p>

    <p>At a glance she saw that it was a diary. Turning the pages
    rapidly, she finally came to one over which she fairly gloated,
    for its information, sold to the proper parties, might make her
    independent for life.</p>

    <p>Even as she was gloating over her find there came the sound
    of many feet in the front hallway. Zita had no time to run out
    of the room before the door opened, giving entrance to six
    emissaries, surrounding her.</p>

    <p>The emissaries locked all the doors and tramped out. Only
    their leader remained for a moment to throw a parting shot.</p>

    <p>"Remember," he threatened, "this house is watched. See that
    you act accordingly. You will, if you know what's good for
    you."</p>

    <p>Then he slammed the door and locked it behind him.</p>

    <p>For a long time Zita sat there, too despairing to move. Then
    her ear caught the sound of stealthy footsteps in the hall, and
    she ran and hid behind the portières. The door opened slowly
    and Paul stole again into the room.</p>

    <p>Having nothing to fear from him, Zita came from her
    hiding-place and confronted him. Paul was startled for a moment
    at her sudden appearance, but recovered himself on seeing that
    it was Zita.</p>

    <p>The paper that he had stolen from his father's desk had
    proved to him that Zita had become highly desirable, and he was
    not one to miss such an opportunity.</p>

    <p>As he questioned her, Zita told him briefly her story, or,
    rather, such portions of it as she thought it desirable for him
    to know. Paul, in turn, assured her of his undying friendship
    and something more. His earnestness almost made it seem true,
    and he talked in his most fascinating and attractive manner. He
    finally ended his conversation with a direct proposal of
    marriage. But he had overstepped the mark and Zita was not to
    be fooled.</p>

    <p>"Paul"&mdash;she laughed scornfully now&mdash;"you should be
    on the stage. It needed only this proposal to prove to me that
    I am really Peter Brent's daughter."</p>

    <p>"Peter Brent's daughter!" he exclaimed. "No, not his
    daughter&mdash;the daughter of Doctor Q."</p>

    <p>"Impossible!" recoiled Zita, astounded at the assertion.</p>

    <p>"True, Zita," he asserted, "absolutely true. Here, look at
    this paper."</p>

    <p>With hands that trembled, Zita took the paper and read an
    amazing table. Unless the paper lied, she was indeed the
    daughter of Doctor Q.</p>

    <p>There was only one thing to do and that was to confront
    Doctor Q at once and force him to a full explanation.</p>

    <p>In order not to antagonize Paul, Zita was now particularly
    nice to him. Her object was to get him to consent to her
    escape, so that she could inform Locke and Eva of her discovery
    and all three confront Doctor Q and wrest from him the
    story.</p>

    <p>At first Paul would not let her go unless she consented to
    marry him, but Zita played him skilfully, so that finally he
    unlocked the door.</p>

    <p>Then Zita flew down the stairs and to a telephone around the
    corner, where she called up Locke, to whom she told as much as
    she dared over the wire.</p>

    <p>Locke told her that he and Eva would meet her within an hour
    in the lobby of one of the city's largest hotels, and Zita
    hastened there, where she waited impatiently until they
    arrived.</p>

    <p>Doctor Q admitted them immediately, and they noticed with
    astonishment the wonderful change for the better that had taken
    place in the man. For with the restoration of his mind all the
    evil lines of his face had been obliterated, as it were, and in
    the place of the doddering half-imbecile they found a genial,
    kindly, and distinguished gentleman who, with the utmost
    hospitality, brought chairs and begged them to be seated.</p>

    <p>Zita, in her anxiety to know the truth, could hardly contain
    her impatience. Tossed from pillar to post, dominated once by
    the strong, evil mind of Balcom, Zita had run the gamut of
    human emotions before she had barely passed her girlhood.</p>

    <p>Seeing her agitation, Locke undertook to interrogate the
    doctor.</p>

    <p>"Doctor Q," he began, "I believe you know the perpetrator of
    the crimes to which we have all been subjected, and we have
    come to you in all friendliness to ask you to clear this
    mystery up for us. Balcom is dead," added Locke, pointedly.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I know that," interrupted Doctor Q.</p>

    <p>"You know?" all asked. "How do you know?"</p>

    <p>The doctor told of having seen Balcom's body. But at first
    he could not explain why he was in the spot at the time.</p>

    <p>Then Locke went on to tell him of the document that Paul had
    shown to Zita.</p>

    <p>Doctor Q sank heavily into a chair.</p>

    <p>"That document that Paul Balcom showed Zita," he exclaimed,
    after a moment, "told the truth."</p>

    <p>All were startled. Zita would have risen with a cry had not
    Locke gently touched her arm.</p>

    <p>"Tell us the story," demanded Locke of Q.</p>

    <p>For some moments Doctor Q seemed to be collecting his
    scattered thoughts, as though still a haze hung over his mind.
    Then he began to speak, becoming more certain of his strange
    story.</p>

    <p>"It was many years ago," he began, as all drew closer about
    him, listening breathlessly to his narrative, "and all these
    years I have been quite mad. The man now lying dead, Balcom,
    was the cause of all these years of misery."</p>

    <p>The old man passed his hand over his head as though to wipe
    away a recollection of hate and fear, then resumed:</p>

    <p>"I was an inventor in those days, and very successful. I had
    built up a great fortune, had built a great house, and in that
    house I had a beautiful wife and two of the loveliest children,
    a boy and a girl, that ever man had."</p>

    <p>He paused again, then went on:</p>

    <p>"One day, a man entered my life and proposed to put my
    inventions on the market very advantageously. He was suave,
    polished, and apparently a gentleman. At any rate, I trusted
    him. You all knew him. It was Herbert Balcom.</p>

    <p>"At the time I did not know that in order to give my
    inventions a clear field the inventions of hundreds of poor
    inventors were to be suppressed. I know now, Miss Brent, that
    your own father was led along in the scheme, even as I was.
    Balcom possessed the master mind and we were all as children in
    his hands."</p>

    <p>Doctor Q stopped a moment. It was evident that he was
    speaking with restraint when it came to Peter Brent, perhaps
    glossing over what the man had done. Though he did not say so,
    the mere fact that at last Brent had seen the light and had
    planned a wholesale restitution weighed supremely in Doctor Q's
    mind.</p>

    <p>"One day," he resumed, "Balcom came to me in what I know now
    was merely feigned excitement and fear. 'They're after us!' he
    cried. 'Brent and I have done our best&mdash;but the government
    is after you, and we can't protect you any longer.'</p>

    <p>"Then for the first time Balcom told me of the real purposes
    of the company, told me that he had been drawn into it by
    Brent. It was all a tissue of lies&mdash;lies that drove me
    from my home and country. I hated your father with an undying
    hate, Miss Brent.</p>

    <p>"Well, to make the sad story short, I took my wife and
    children and sailed secretly for the farthermost parts of the
    world. Off the coast of Madagascar, in the Straits, a typhoon
    came up. The vessel was driven on the rocks and wrecked. I was
    cast ashore, and I vaguely remember how, for days and weeks, I
    patrolled that beach, subsisting on shell-fish, imploring God,
    day and night, to restore my wife and children to me. Then my
    mind gave way.</p>

    <p>"The natives took me in, thinking me a god. They took me
    many miles inland. Savages, the world over, are superstitious
    about the demented, and so they treated me kindly. They
    installed me in a thatched hut of my own and made me a
    leader.</p>

    <p>"How many months, years, I stayed with them I do not know.
    But, true to my mechanical instinct, I rigged up a forge and
    improved many of the crude instruments of the natives,
    principally those of agriculture.</p>

    <p>"But transcending every other feeling, I hated Brent. In my
    madness, I conceived the idea that I would construct an iron
    giant that, upon its completion, if I could only procure the
    brain of a man who had died of a lightning stroke or other
    electric agency, I could, by installing this brain in the brain
    cavity of the giant, give it volition, make it a superman
    without feeling or conscience. It was a mad idea&mdash;but I
    was mad.</p>

    <p>"At about this time Balcom came to Madagascar. He found me
    and, knowing my intense hatred of Peter Brent, he cruelly added
    fuel to the fire. Already he must have known that Brent was
    coming to his senses and planning his great restitution to
    genius.</p>

    <p>"He promised me that if I would come to New York with him he
    would secure an electrocuted brain so that I could perfect my
    steel automaton and obtain my revenge. I was easily persuaded
    and I sailed with Balcom, bringing the iron monster with
    me."</p>

    <p>A strange light gleamed in the old man's eyes as he spoke,
    not the light of madness, but of kindliness now.</p>

    <p>"Children," he said, at length, "I have, during these lucid
    moments, watched you all closely. Call it instinct if you will,
    but you, Zita, and you, Quentin, seem to be particularly dear
    to me now. To-day, returning from the scene of the explosion,
    with every faculty not only clear, but rather sharpened by long
    disuse, I pieced the years, the months, even the days together.
    I searched in an old trunk and I found&mdash;this."</p>

    <p>It was a list of those rescued from the steamer
    <i>Magnifique</i>, and with amazement they read the names among
    the passengers:</p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">QUENTIN
    LOCKE</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">ZITA LOCKE</span><br />
    <br />
    <p>There was a short note at the bottom of the list, to the
    effect that no trace of either the father or the mother of the
    two children had been found.</p>



    <p>Paper after paper which Doctor Q had found, where they had
    been preserved by Balcom, proved the identification and the
    story.</p>

    <p>Locke's head was in a whirl at the sudden change in
    relationships, but not more so than Zita's. Finally Zita could
    stand the strain no longer. What had been a hopeless love was
    now explained.</p>

    <p>"My&mdash;my brother!" she sobbed, as she buried her head on
    Quentin's shoulder.</p>

    <p>Both turned to Doctor Q&mdash;Doctor Q no longer, but really
    Quentin Locke, senior, whence had come the "Q."</p>

    <p>His eyes filled with tears and his voice choked.</p>

    <p>"My&mdash;children," he murmured, "I see that it is not too
    late for me to find happiness, after all. Our enemy is dead. It
    was Balcom, of course, who was in that frame of armor, who used
    that terrible poison that stole away Brent's mind. The iron
    monster will walk no more. Henceforth Peter Brent and Miss Eva
    and you, Quentin&mdash;will&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Doctor Q had not time to finish the sentence.</p>

    <p>The door burst inward.</p>

    <p>The Automaton, its eyes aflame, stalked in among them!</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

    <p>As the Automaton crashed its way into the room all sprang
    back terrified, aghast.</p>

    <p>For this monster, they had felt sure, was now nothing but an
    inanimate shell of armor, since Balcom was dead.</p>

    <p>Yet here it was, stalking toward them and evidently as bent
    on destruction as ever.</p>

    <p>What did it mean?</p>

    <p>In an instant Locke had helped Eva through an open window
    and turned to assist Zita. But Doctor Q forestalled him and had
    already taken her in his arms and had fled with her into
    another room.</p>

    <p>For the moment Locke was surprised to see that the Automaton
    totally ignored him. Instead, it stalked to the door and
    wrenched it open. There, cowering in the hall, in abject
    terror, was De Luxe Dora.</p>

    <p>How and why she had come there was a mystery. But the
    Automaton did not hesitate. It raised its hands and, as it did
    so, long flashes of blue flame leaped from the steel
    finger-tips toward the unfortunate woman. Once she shrieked,
    then crumpled and fell dead.</p>

    <p>The monster then turned its attention to Locke, striding
    toward him with a menacing gesture. But the diversion due to
    Dora had given all just the time they needed to make good their
    flight. Locke threw a chair to impede the progress of the
    monster, and then, as he saw that all the others were safe, he
    lightly vaulted out of the window himself, to find them waiting
    for him in the little yard below.</p>

    <p>"What do you make of it now&mdash;father?" asked Locke of
    Doctor Q. "Balcom is dead. Who is now in the iron man?"</p>

    <p>Doctor Q shrugged. It was a mystery to him as much as ever,
    and he seemed unable to throw any light on it.</p>

    <p>"But De Luxe Dora," queried Zita. "What had she come for?
    Why was she struck down&mdash;first?"</p>

    <p>Again Doctor Q shook his head.</p>

    <p>From the yard they could hear the Automaton's heavy tread in
    the room and, as there was nothing to be gained by remaining,
    they left the yard and hurried away out of the
    neighborhood.</p>

    <p>They had not gone far, however, when Doctor Locke came to a
    full stop.</p>

    <p>"I must go back," he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>For a moment all thought he had again taken leave of his
    senses. Yet he was obdurate.</p>

    <p>"Miss Brent&mdash;Eva," he explained, "you know that a
    grievous wrong has been done your father through me. He lies
    ill of that most terrible of diseases, the laughing madness. I
    alone possess the antidote, and it is in the laboratory that we
    have just left. I pray that that iron beast has not destroyed
    it."</p>

    <p>At the mere words Locke turned as if to go back for it.</p>

    <p>"No, Quentin," remonstrated his father. "You must remain to
    guard Eva."</p>

    <p>"Then I will go," insisted Zita. "I am not afraid now. Even
    when the monster carried me off I overcame my fear, watched my
    chance, and escaped from his den, where he left me. I will
    go."</p>

    <p>Finally Doctor Locke agreed that Zita might return with him,
    remain outside, and give the alarm if anything happened to him.
    Thus, after many remonstrances, it was agreed, and Eva and
    Quentin went on to Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>No one had molested Brent in the mean time. The terror
    caused by the explosion, as well as the loss of Balcom, for the
    time, at least, had evidently cowed the emissary band.</p>

    <p>While Eva made Brent comfortable, Locke went immediately to
    the laboratory, where he had something which he considered very
    important.</p>

    <p>"Quentin," remarked Eva, as she joined him, "your father
    spoke the truth, I believe, when he said that it was Balcom in
    the Automaton, But if that was the case, who is in it now?"</p>

    <p>Locke shook his head dubiously. "I give it up," he replied.
    "It's too deep for me. But whoever it is, he won't trouble us
    long, I'll wager. I've been perfecting a special gun and an
    explosive-gas bullet. No one can shoot the monster. Nothing
    seems to stop it. But this weapon, I think, will at last prove
    a match for it."</p>

    <p>Eva, who had always had the deepest interest in Quentin's
    work, listened attentively as he explained in detail the
    working of the new weapon.</p>

    <p>"And now we come to the actual loading of these
    asphyxiating-poison bullets," concluded Quentin. "I really must
    ask you, Eva, to go into another room, for it is dangerous work
    and you must not risk your life here."</p>

    <p>"But, Quentin," remonstrated Eva, "we've risked our lives so
    often together that I have ceased to be afraid of
    anything."</p>

    <p>Quentin was insistent, and finally Eva agreed.</p>

    <p>As Doctor Q and Zita neared the former's laboratory, they
    saw that all the lights in the house were out. Doctor Locke,
    against Zita's advice, insisted on going in, and told his
    daughter to wait outside. It was then that Zita disobeyed her
    father for the first time, for she flatly refused to be left
    behind.</p>

    <p>"No," she insisted. "I found a father to-night and what we
    must risk we risk together. It is no worse than the peril from
    which I once escaped."</p>

    <p>There was no reasoning with Zita, and they let themselves
    into the little yard and went up the back steps. When they came
    to the door of the laboratory they listened intently.</p>

    <p>There was no sound. Then they mustered up courage and
    cautiously entered the room. For a long time they stood quite
    still, not daring to move. Finally Doctor Q suddenly lighted a
    match.</p>

    <p>The room was in terrible confusion, as though
    cyclone-swept.</p>

    <p>Doctor Locke turned on an electric bulb and the room was
    flooded with light.</p>

    <p>Everywhere there were traces of the Automaton. But the
    monster itself had left the place. Doctor Locke crossed to the
    other door. There was a sight that made them shudder. The body
    of De Luxe Dora was still huddled in a heap on the floor. She
    was quite dead.</p>

    <p>But Doctor Locke had no time now to waste. Moments were
    precious. At any instant they might again be attacked.
    Feverishly he began to search for the bottle containing the
    antidote.</p>

    <p>At last he found it, carefully hidden, and in a bottle
    fortunately not broken.</p>

    <p>They left everything as it was and hurriedly left the place,
    on their way to Brent Rock.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in one of the worst quarters of the city, down in
    the cellar of a huge warehouse, a mob of emissaries were
    gathered. They were discussing the things that had led up to
    the explosion in the Automaton's den, Balcom's death, and the
    arrest of their three pals. Plans for the future they
    discussed, but, with their leader gone, these hardened men were
    still as helpless as children.</p>

    <p>Suddenly above the din of voices a strange, familiar sound
    was heard, a sound as of clanking chains, and the blood froze
    in the veins of every man present. Then with wild shouts of
    terror they scattered in every direction, for the Automaton was
    stalking toward them.</p>

    <p>Balcom, the man who had given the iron man life, was dead.
    And yet the Automaton was among them!</p>

    <p>That night, in the holds of many vessels and on the
    brake-beams of many trains pulling away from the city,
    emissaries who once were slaves of the Automaton were fleeing
    the city in every direction.</p>

    <p>When Zita and her father arrived at Brent Rock, Locke was
    still working at his new gas-gun. Eva was in the library, but
    when she heard the voices in the hallway she ran to welcome
    them.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I'm so glad you've both returned safe," she cried.
    Then, unable to withstand the suspense longer, she asked, "Have
    you brought it&mdash;the antidote?"</p>

    <p>When Doctor Locke told her that the bottle that contained it
    was safely stowed in his pocket Eva sank, overwrought, into a
    chair and cried with simple relief and joy.</p>

    <p>In a moment, however, she had gained control of herself,
    dashed the tears from her eyes, and almost seized the bottle
    from Doctor Locke.</p>

    <p>"Bring him down here, my dear," cautioned the doctor, still
    holding the bottle. "You would not know how to administer
    it."</p>

    <p>Eva ran to her father's room, stopping only long enough to
    summon Quentin, then together they led Brent down-stairs.</p>

    <p>Brent's condition was still pitiable. His mind was a total
    blank. These people&mdash;Doctor Q, Zita, Quentin, even his own
    daughter&mdash;meant nothing to him. He lived and breathed. But
    no ray of light entered the poor brain.</p>

    <p>They guided his halting steps into the library as if he had
    been something less than a child, and placed him in the same
    big armchair on which he had sunk the fatal morning that the
    fumes from the candles had overcome him.</p>

    <p>Doctor Q drew out the bottle and, telling Zita to bring a
    glass of water, measured out a few drops of the antidote,
    pouring them into the glass. Then he moved over to Brent and
    tried to get him to drink it. For a long time Brent merely
    clenched his teeth, but, once he was induced to taste the
    mixture, he drank it eagerly.</p>

    <p>For ages, it seemed to those watching, Brent sat as before,
    vacantly gazing straight ahead of him&mdash;so long, in fact,
    that a terrible fear entered Eva's heart that, perhaps, after
    all, the antidote would fail and that her father would remain
    without reason until the day of his death.</p>

    <p>Then slowly a change was noticeable in his eyes, and all
    leaned forward with overpowering intentness. What they were
    watching was like a miracle. Slowly, very slowly, they saw the
    soul creep back into those poor, mad eyes.</p>

    <p>Brent had been staring directly at his daughter as she
    watched him anxiously. Now a puzzled look came over his face
    and, raising a hand, he rubbed his forehead.</p>

    <p>Then a wonderful light seemed to shine from his eyes and he
    held out his arms to Eva.</p>

    <p>With a sob of excited happiness Eva rushed to embrace
    him.</p>

    <p>As Locke stood behind him, Zita and Doctor Q walked to the
    other end of the room, turning sidewise to the group.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Brent turned his eyes away from Eva and noticed
    Doctor Q for the first time.</p>

    <p>"Who is that?" he asked Eva.</p>

    <p>"Why, father, that is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At the sound of voices Doctor Q had turned around.</p>

    <p>"You!" gasped Brent, as he sank back into his chair.</p>

    <p>The look on his face was strange, perhaps half fear, half
    shame.</p>

    <p>Doctor Q came no nearer for a moment, while Eva hastened to
    explain what had happened. Then unsteadily Brent rose and
    walked over to the doctor.</p>

    <p>"You are alive!" he exclaimed. "You have come again into my
    life so that at last I can make restitution. My daughter has
    explained to me all that you have suffered. Believe me it was
    through my own weakness. It seems incredible that any man could
    be so infamous, so utterly without moral scruples, as was
    Balcom. I believed the villain implicitly. That is, and can be,
    my only excuse."</p>

    <p>The doctor placed his hand on Brent's shoulder.</p>

    <p>"I can understand only too well," he remarked, "for I, too,
    believed in Balcom. You were a reticent man and so my dealings
    were all with him. I was gullible, an inventor, not a business
    man. I should have come to you before I fled the country, I
    suppose. Say no more about it, for I forgive you from the
    bottom of my heart."</p>

    <p>But Brent insisted on explaining that at least he had had a
    desire to right the great wrongs.</p>

    <p>"I can remember it all now," he continued. "I was about to
    make restitution when a man connected with the company&mdash;I
    am sure now that he was an adventurer, a crook, in the pay of
    Balcom, although Balcom probably tried to hide it&mdash;came to
    me. His name, as I remember it, was Flint. I was about to write
    a letter that showed that it was my intention to right a wrong,
    when&mdash;something interrupted me and&mdash;the rest I can't
    remember."</p>

    <p>Quentin, who had been standing behind the chair, now drew
    from his pocket a piece of paper which he handed to Brent.</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;that is it," cried Brent, excitedly, taking it,
    and spreading it out before them. "See!"</p>

    <p>It was a note addressed to Quentin Locke and read:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I have done you a great wrong about which you know
        nothing, but for which I will make amends&mdash;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"It was broken off," exclaimed Brent, making a sad effort to
    recollect what had happened. "I don't remember how. But this
    Flint had been telling me something about an iron monster. He
    had a model&mdash;said he had seen the real thing in
    Madagascar, that it had a human brain, that it walked and
    fought, that it had strength and life&mdash;but no conscience.
    He hinted that the thing would do me harm if I persisted in a
    course that I had determined for myself of giving back to
    inventors we had robbed the things of which we had robbed them.
    I did not believe him. I thought the thing absurd, and started
    to write the note, going a step farther than I had ever
    threatened Balcom."</p>

    <p>Quentin, Doctor Q, and Zita exchanged glances as Eva's
    father resumed his narrative.</p>

    <p>"Then I felt a choking sensation at my throat. I remember
    the effrontery of Flint's laughing at me, in a maudlin sort of
    way, and then&mdash;a blank. The next I recall was just
    now&mdash;Eva gazing at me with a worried expression in her
    dear eyes. I called to her and kissed her, tried to comfort
    her. Then I saw you, Locke, and Zita."</p>

    <p>Peter Brent, from the time he and Flint had been overcome by
    the fumes from the candelabra until he received the antidote
    and recognized his daughter, had not known a thing!</p>

    <p>As they talked there were many matters the two aged men
    discovered while they pieced together the happenings of
    years.</p>

    <p>Each had been duped by the same man. Each had suffered great
    trouble through this man's machinations and duplicity.</p>

    <p>As they talked, the attention of both turned to the younger
    Quentin Locke, who seemed overjoyed at the recovery of his
    former employer.</p>

    <p>Brent had a very great feeling of affection and respect for
    the younger man, for had he not really brought him up?</p>

    <p>As all questioned one another, they asked Brent much about
    the past, and he told them all.</p>

    <p>He told how he had become finally suspicious of Balcom, of
    how he insisted upon instituting a search for the doctor, his
    wife, and children. He told how Balcom had opposed him up to
    the last moment. Then he described his sailing half the world
    over in search of them, how at times he found a trail, only to
    lose it again.</p>

    <p>Finally he told how at last he had found that the mother had
    been lost, but the children saved.</p>

    <p>"I was in Bombay," he continued, "in despair that I would
    ever find any of you. At that time I was an old man before my
    time, for my conscience gave me no rest. I went down to the
    quay to purchase a ticket for my return to New York, and, true
    to the habit I had formed, I asked the ticket-seller if he had
    ever heard anything of the survivors of the steamer
    <i>Magnifique</i>.</p>

    <p>"'Do I know anything of it?' repeated the ticket-seller.
    'No, but there's a man working on this dock now who never talks
    of anything else. He was a sailor on the ship and one of the
    few who survived.'</p>

    <p>"You can believe me when I tell you that I ran down that
    dock and found the man. He remembered you all well, remembered
    you children when you were taken up with some other survivors,
    and he said he thought that some family had taken you to
    Hong-Kong.</p>

    <p>"I canceled my passage to Liverpool and immediately sailed
    for China. Still, my troubles were not over, for it was weeks
    before I finally located you babies, Quentin and Zita.</p>

    <p>"I won't burden you with the difficulties I encountered
    before the English family, the Danes, with whom I found you,
    would consent to give you up. Nor will I take time to tell of
    our return to New York through San Francisco.</p>

    <p>"Let it suffice for you to know that we arrived safely after
    I had completely circled the world. I sent you to good schools,
    and when Zita was old enough I made her my secretary so that I
    could watch over her. Quentin, being older, I had not dared to
    have around at first. I feared he might question me too
    closely. And what answer could I give him? Could I tell him
    that International Patents had driven his father into exile,
    that I had been partly the cause, the indirect cause, it is
    true, but still the cause of his mother's death? I never found
    the courage to do that and so I sent him to a preparatory
    school and later to college. Years wiped out his childhood
    recollections and when he came here he came as a stranger
    employed in the company's laboratory. I make no defense, but I
    assure you all that my own sufferings have atoned for all the
    wrongs I have done."</p>

    <p>Brent broke down and was almost weeping, when Quentin and
    Eva moved over to his side and reassured him.</p>

    <p>As soon as Brent had recovered from his weakness he wanted
    to know all that had happened since he had been unconscious
    under the drug, and as he listened he was aghast at the
    Automaton and Balcom's villainy.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"I've something here that will stop him, though," added
    Quentin, as he showed the new gas-gun he had invented and
    explained its deadly properties. "Bring him on again&mdash;I'm
    ready."</p>

    <p>"Quentin&mdash;please don't joke about that terrible
    monster," shivered Eva. "It has injured us so often&mdash;I
    don't even want to talk about it&mdash;or about the government
    that asked you to come here and set things right. Let us
    forget&mdash;now that all is right."</p>

    <p>Quentin smiled at her and his quick mind saw that the time
    had come to guide the conversation into pleasanter channels. He
    moved close to Brent.</p>

    <p>"It looks, Mr. Brent," he said, quietly, "as though we all
    were at about the end of our troubles. But there are two of us
    here who are not quite happy&mdash;yet. Mr. Brent, I am going
    to claim a reward."</p>

    <p>"Anything, my dear Locke, anything I have is yours."</p>

    <p>"Then I may as well tell you that Eva and I love each other
    and I want your consent to our marriage."</p>

    <p>Brent beamed.</p>

    <p>"That, Quentin, is the dearest wish my heart can have."</p>

    <p>Quentin turned to Eva to take her in his arms when there was
    a terrific crash of glass in the conservatory, the splintering
    of wood, and the Automaton, arms swinging like flails, charged
    like a mad thing into the room.</p>

    <p>Its terrorizing eyes were agleam, its one desire
    destruction. A large table stood in its way and it demolished
    it as though it were matchwood.</p>

    <p>The interruption came so abruptly that Brent, who in his
    right mind had never seen the fiend and was now seeing it for
    the first time, was paralyzed with horror. He tried to rise
    from his chair, but in his weak condition fell back,
    helpless.</p>

    <p>Quentin made a flying leap over the demolished table and
    placed himself directly in front of Brent and in the path of
    the monster. Doctor Q, Zita, and Eva started for Locke's side,
    but he waved them back frantically.</p>

    <p>Locke reached into his pocket and drew out his gas-pistol.
    The Automaton was almost upon him when he raised his arm and
    fired.</p>

    <p>There was a blinding flash and a dull report. The Automaton
    stopped in his tracks and, raising one mighty hand to its
    chest, staggered backward. Again Quentin fired, and the
    Automaton slowly crumpled, sinking to one knee. There was no
    need to fire again, for suddenly the monster crashed to the
    floor and lay still.</p>

    <p>Locke started forward, but Eva shrieked for him to stand
    back. She had not forgotten that once she had thought the
    monster dead and it had suddenly seized her and almost crushed
    out her life.</p>

    <p>There was, however, nothing to fear this time. Quentin
    reassured her that the gas fumes had passed away, then knelt by
    the iron terror. He tried to remove the steel headpiece, but
    before he could accomplish it the doctor came forward and in a
    moment had unfastened the bolts.</p>

    <p>As they were doing so a thick voice from inside could be
    distinguished, muttering words about the capture of Brent and
    Zita just before Balcom was killed, the escape of Zita, the
    rescue of Brent, the killing of Dora, who had evidently come to
    betray something in jealousy. It was all incoherent and Doctor
    Q and Quentin hastened to uncasque the man within.</p>

    <p>They lifted off the helmet and there was the contorted and
    dying face of Paul Balcom, who had, in desperation, taken his
    father's place in a vain hope to secure the fortune for
    himself.</p>

    <p>The poison was too strong, and as the girls turned,
    sickened, away, the evil features froze, more evil than ever
    they had been in his evil life.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />

    <p>A few days later a brilliant wedding took place at Brent
    Rock, which itself was a present to the bride and groom.</p>

    <p>After the guests had thinned out, Quentin and Eva strolled
    into the garden, no longer in fear of attack from the steel
    Automaton.</p>

    <p>Eva glanced at her ring, musing.</p>

    <p>"After all the things from which you have escaped, dear,"
    she murmured, a bit timidly, "I am afraid nothing in the world
    can hold you."</p>

    <p>Quentin drew her into his arms, while her hand rested on his
    shoulder, and kissed the little golden ring that encircled her
    finger.</p>

    <p>"Nothing but that band of love," he smiled.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
